<h2 id="the-saturnian-orb-of-hope">1. The Saturnian Orb of Hope</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was neither short nor tall but not average either, with wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair and multi hued eyes. She had a perfect forehead that she inherited from her mother’s side. She was sporting an elegant shimmering multi hued polyester frock with dark purple star patterns and some exquisite crimson and purple polyester trousers with crimson lightning bolt patterns. On her feet she wore some dark purple silk pixie boots with dark purple rayon trim.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the air conditioning unit. He was rather tall, with close cropped black hair and grey eyes. He had a deep chin, the sort you only see in old movies. He was sporting a blue green leather jersey and some brown crinkly foil slacks. Some blue nylon sandals with silver coloured stripes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was somewhat short, with short blonde hair and green eyes. Her narrow forehead complemented her other features highly. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she said with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was studiously polishing the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy. She was gotten up in a red dacron dress. The navy blue cotton pumps that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,” Dwight Edgmont sighed laughingly. He surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope into the light. Just then, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Drat,” drawled Captain Dwight quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith moved her soft yet masterful hand in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury pointed towards Captain Dwight. He was a bit on the short side, but in a cute way, with short blonde hair and green eyes. He had a handsome brow, the type you only see in the Outer Colonies. He was decked out in a chartreuse polyester hoodie and some pinstripe cotton slacks. His feet were shod with some purple cotton sneakers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight moved her smooth yet confident hand in the direction of Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a courier drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith’s head. “What in Sam Hill was that?” she splurted emphatically. She blinked firmly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned Serenity Starlight to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk to you about”, he began enigmatically.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Ensign Serenity.</p>
<p>“Well, about the other day in the mess hall…” whispered Commander Joe painfully.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity blushed a deep red. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury’s lips.</p>
<p>With a supple yet powerful motion, Tammy Smith picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she shouted drily. From out of nowhere, a delivery drone buzzed by her head. “What in the world was that?” she said firmly. She blinked gratingly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked around. She all of a sudden had a unusual hunch. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Captain Dwight. “There was some top notch thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he giggled laughingly. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, Ensign Serenity!” he drawled blissfully.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James calmly. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “I could really go for a hamburger right now,” she giggled fawningly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont slumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” said Navigator Tammy lightly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Dwight Edgmont,” sighed Commander Joe calmly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="nebulon-the-dastardly">2. Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. A navigation dashboard seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the navigation dashboard. She was looking delightful in a marvellous shimmering rainbow hued rayon frock with crimson lacy frills and some beautiful silver coloured nylon slacks with purple and gold moon beam patterns. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel. The blue and purple crinkly foil pumps with purple and violet lightning bolt patterns she was sporting seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Hello, Commander Joe Mulbury,” chirped Captain Dwight Edgmont strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the communications panel. The blue green polyester jumper she was wearing seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod with some plaid silk shoes with gaudy navy blue polka dots.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was cracking open walnuts with the Chalice of Dreams. He was looking smashing in a blue denim sweater with tie dyed stripes and some blue green crinkly foil culottes. Some pink rayon dress shoes with plaid leather trim were on his feet.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight. He was looking exciting in a silver coloured leather trench coat with orange red polyester trim. The gold coloured crinkly foil sandals that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“It’s not the sort of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Captain Dwight,” Commander Joe smiled laughingly.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a cooking drone whizzed past Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What was that?” he said firmly. He smiled courageously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked around. He held the Chalice of Dreams in his hand. Suddenly, he lost his balance. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of his grasp. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short blonde locks.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy looked at him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont wasn’t going to let a little thing like this cramp his style, though. He glared in the direction of Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight glanced irksomely at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! She was of average height, with long green hair and green eyes. She had a overbearing mouth, the kind you only see in comic books. She was looking villanous in a dark black silk smock. On her feet she wore some blood coloured denim dress shoes.</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” screeched Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. “We meet again, chums!” she whispered with a voice like a baboon in a mosh pit. She snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy clapped her hands to the sides of her face in surprise.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury screeched “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” bellowed Ensign Serenity irritatedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the star charts that were nearby. She lifted the star charts to eye level. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she muttered emphatically.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight motioned Commander Joe to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I need to say to you”, she began awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ms. O’James?” asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Uh, about last night in the engine room…” gasped Ensign Serenity carefully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe went beet red with blushing. “Hush, Ensign Serenity, there’s no need, you know that,” he said carefully.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Nearby was a door to the dungeon. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” gulped Tammy Smith enigmatically. She was looking frumpy in a navy blue cotton top and some tasteless brown dacron leggings with gaudy plaid polka dots. On her feet she wore some bleak orange red nylon pumps with gaudy purple polka dots.</p>
<p>“Enviro measurements look normal,” drawled Commander Joe, looking down at his hyper crystal’s enviro probe app.</p>
<p>“… For a DISASTER AREA!!” said Navigator Tammy irritatedly.</p>
<p>Walking along, Serenity Starlight unexpectedly smacked her head against an invisible force field. She was decked out in an elegant pale violet leather top with pale indigo moon beam patterns and some fantastic purple and violet leather culottes with frilly purple and white lace. The fantastic pale purple rayon shoes with frilly rainbow coloured lace that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“What was that?” droned Navigator Tammy grumpily. Walking along, she unexpectedly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we can get through this we’ll have to find another way in!” mumbled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James enigmatically. “We have a duty to rescue Captain Dwight Edgmont!” she droned weakly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the wasteland. There was a gravel pit off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” gasped Tammy Smith grumpily.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James dialed up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro measurements look normal,” said Ensign Serenity irritatedly. She was looking impressive in an elegant shimmering rainbow hued silk smock with frilly black and purple lace. Her feet were shod with some fantastic crimson and violet silk pixie boots adorned with jewels.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a PIT!!” gasped Tammy Smith heavily. She was wearing an ill fitting orange leather halter top and some ill fitting blue green silk slacks. Some black silk pixie boots with gaudy pink polka dots were on her feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was rather tall, with shoulder length green hair and grey eyes. He had a ugly brow that the other kids made fun of back when he was in school. He was looking menacing in a black silk muscle shirt and some snappy midnight black rayon leggings. The midnight black dacron sneakers on his feet seemed to shine in the harsh sun light.</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Serenity Starlight screeched.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. “What have we here!” he drawled with a voice like a hurricane at a baseball game. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made motions of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was a puddle of icky looking liquid. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Navigator Tammy shouted gratingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in a handsome maroon rayon muscle shirt and some handsome maroon dacron trousers. Some orange red cotton boots graced his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Navigator Tammy,” he said lightly. “I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight,” he stated happily. “Let’s keep moving,” he sighed virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he chirped blissfully. “I would have been a goner without you, Commander Joe,” he stated happily. He was looking exciting in a maroon dacron trench coat. The fine pink nylon sneakers with red stripes that he had on looked almost new. “I am in debt to you, Ensign Serenity,” he stated enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James surveyed the area with her eyes. She was looking smashing in a beautiful gold coloured cotton trench coat adorned with emeralds. Her feet were shod in some exquisite shimmering rainbow coloured leather shoes with silver and purple star patterns. She all of a sudden had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelped Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“You displayed some top notch thinking today, Serenity Starlight!” whispered Dwight Edgmont firmly. He was resplendent in a violet denim great coat. On his feet he wore some fine blue green cotton trainers. “I think I should promote you to Lieutenant, Serenity Starlight!” he chirped fawningly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” chirped Ensign Serenity, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. “I’m too modest, I like being a Ensign too!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she said placidly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe flumped down on the couch. He was wearing a blue green polyester trench coat. His feet were shod with some orange dacron sneakers.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” drawled Captain Dwight strongly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Joe Mulbury,” breathed Serenity Starlight courageously.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">3. The Return of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. There was a navigation dashboard off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the Captain’s chair. She was looking delightful in a fantastic silver and purple silk jerkin with crimson and purple star patterns and some beautiful purple and violet silk culottes with dark indigo polyester trim. The elegant purple and gold polyester boots with silvery lightning bolt patterns she was wearing seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of eggs,” whispered Commander Joe Mulbury peacefully. He was wearing a fine navy blue silk smock with silver coloured crinkly foil trim. The red dacron dress shoes that he had on looked almost new. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the view screen. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he giggled with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the view screen. He was looking exciting in a green rayon great coat. His deep chin seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. Some handsome tan cotton dress shoes with red dacron trim graced his feet.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of Space Sugar,” smiled Navigator Tammy Smith blissfully. She was looking frumpy in a maroon leather track suit. On her feet she wore some outdated purple denim pixie boots. “Hello, Dwight Edgmont,” she breathed virtuously.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity was cracking open walnuts with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Dwight Edgmont,” Ms. O’James smiled lightly. Her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a smooth yet masterful motion, he lifted the cup of coffee. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he giggled peacefully.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking intimidating in a handsome blood coloured polyester shirt and some fine deep red dacron trousers. On his feet he wore some snappy midnight black cotton dress shoes with blood coloured polyester trim.</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” yelled Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. “I have you now!” he stated with a voice like a hurricane at a monster truck rally. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his shoulder length green hair. He grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith’s mouth opened wide in shock.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight put his hands on the sides of his face in disbelief.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made gestures of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she barked irritatedly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area. She held the Venusian Staff of Power in her hand. Without warning, she tripped. She lost her grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy gestured towards her.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont glanced happily at Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a security drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith’s head. Her short blonde hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. “What was that?” she shouted menacingly. She blinked heavily.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity looked around. She all of a sudden had a odd hunch. She looked behind the nearby pulsing red and green lights. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” cried Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A door to the dungeon gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” muttered Navigator Tammy enigmatically. She was wearing a black nylon suit jacket with a tacky navy blue zig zag pattern and some mauve leather slacks with gaudy floral print polka dots. The maroon rayon trainers that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Enviro metrics look normal,” stated Serenity Starlight, peering down at her hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. The WICKED AWESOME crimson dacron top with purple and violet lacy frills she was looking fine in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. Some marvellous shimmering rainbow hued dacron trainers with frilly multi coloured lace graced her feet.</p>
<p>“… For a DUMP!!” groaned Tammy Smith heavily. Walking along, she suddenly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“What in blazes was that?” drawled Dwight Edgmont energetically. Walking along, he surprisedly whacked his head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we can get through this we’ll have to find another way in!” muttered Tammy Smith irritatedly. “We have a duty to rescue Commander Joe Mulbury!” she mumbled sadly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The blasted surface of Forbak was a sight to behold. Some sickly shrubs gleamed in the harsh sun light. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the creeps,” said Serenity Starlight exasperatedly. She was looking impressive in an elegant shiny silver dacron halter top adorned with gems and some WICKED AWESOME midnight black rayon slacks with frilly white lace. Her feet were shod in some marvellous shiny purple silk trainers with gold coloured star patterns.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro measurements look normal,” sighed Dwight Edgmont calmly.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a DUMP!!” bleated Ensign Serenity sadly.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“Did you hear something?” Dwight Edgmont stated. He was resplendent in a pink cotton sweater with pinstripe stripes and some brown rayon slacks with maroon stripes. The silver coloured cotton boots that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the crumbling arch caved in!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy just stared, seemingly paralyzed. She was buried under rubble. She was looking frumpy in a floral print crinkly foil smock. Some tacky green rayon pumps were on her feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight exclaimed “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” gulped Ms. O’James grumpily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James were attacked by some Space Snails.</p>
<p>A intense battle had begun!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, stunned Space Snails littered the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” chirped Dwight Edgmont enigmatically. “It looked like those Space Snails had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their jerseys,” he smiled happily. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” groaned Ensign Serenity slowly.</p>
<p>“Hurry!” Dwight Edgmont breathed. He helped dig Tammy Smith out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to lose!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James shouted. She helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Captain Dwight,” said Tammy Smith blissfully. “I would have been toast without you, Ensign Serenity,” she giggled courageously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James spotted some Space Weasels in the distance.</p>
<p>“Uh oh, looks like they’ve found us,” smiled Dwight Edgmont obsequiously.</p>
<p>“Ampjfp iiqr imobo wxb ozdg bxkl!!!” shouted the Space Weasels in their weird Space Weasel language.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle commenced!</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, stunned Space Weasels were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” said Tammy Smith icily. “It looked like those Space Weasels had The Skull Witch’s insignia on their armor,” she stated energetically. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” gasped Ms. O’James downheartedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A puddle of icky looking liquid seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ms. O’James mumbled downheartedly. She was wearing a beautiful multi coloured dacron smock with rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod with some elegant dark violet crinkly foil boots with pale purple polyester trim.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was wearing a snappy white leather long coat. On his feet he wore some snappy violet cotton sneakers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,” he breathed virtuously. “Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,” he said enigmatically. “I would have been toast without you, Ms. O’James,” he breathed fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. There was a view screen off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some ace thinking today, Ensign Serenity!” stated Captain Dwight strongly. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, Ms. O’James!” he giggled courageously. He was wearing an orange rayon top with silver coloured cotton trim and some snappy purple crinkly foil culottes. The fine white denim trainers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” sighed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was sporting an exquisite pale violet rayon jacket with multi coloured lacy frills and some black and purple polyester leggings with frilly purple and white lace. Her feet were shod in some exquisite shiny silver nylon trainers with gold coloured star patterns. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “I could really go for a pizza right now,” she drawled laughingly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” smiled Commander Joe calmly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a hot dog right now,” stated Dwight Edgmont happily.</p>
<p>With a graceful yet masterful motion, Tammy Smith slumped down on the bean bag chair. She was gotten up in a tie dyed dacron suit jacket with gaudy gold coloured polka dots and a blue green silk skirt with a tacky blue zig zag pattern. On her feet she wore some pinstripe polyester trainers with a tacky purple zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” chirped Commander Joe virtuously.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-skull-witch">4. The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. Not too far away was a communications panel. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the view screen. She was looking delightful in a deep indigo nylon jerkin with silvery lightning bolt patterns and some exquisite deep indigo polyester culottes with dark violet polyester trim. Some beautiful white dacron pumps with silvery lacy frills were on her feet. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the view screen.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. He was sporting a fine gold coloured cotton shirt and some fine violet denim leggings. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel. The snappy red crinkly foil trainers that were on his feet looked almost new. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he giggled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the view screen.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the Captain’s chair. She was wearing an outdated violet crinkly foil tank top and some tacky orange red cotton leggings. On her feet she wore some bleak floral print nylon pixie boots. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” she giggled laughingly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was intently buffing the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Ms. O’James,” Joe Mulbury sighed virtuously. He surveyed the area. With a smooth yet confident motion, he lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity. Suddenly, he lost his balance. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of his grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“Whoops,” gasped Commander Joe quietly.</p>
<p>With a soft yet confident motion, Tammy Smith pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glared in the direction of Joe Mulbury. He put his hand up to his deep chin. He was resplendent in a snappy tie dyed cotton robe. The handsome floral print cotton sandals on his feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking intimidating in a deep black cotton top and some deep red leather slacks. His ugly brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod in some handsome midnight black cotton sandals with red stripes.</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Ensign Serenity screamed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. “So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!” he breathed with a voice like a samurai in a performance art piece. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont placidly.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She lifted the electro wrench to eye level. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” she yelled outrageously. Out of the blue, a cleaning drone buzzed by her head. Her narrow forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. “What was that?” she groaned emphatically. She grimaced impatiently.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” cried Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wildly. “I have you now!” she drawled with a voice like a baboon in a snowstorm. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. She was gotten up in a fine dark red silk jumpsuit. Some deep black rayon sandals graced her feet. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont put his hands on his cheeks in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James screeched “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A torch in a thing on the wall gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” groaned Serenity Starlight drably. She was looking fine in an exquisite blue and purple polyester blouse with dark purple lightning bolt patterns and some elegant dark violet silk culottes with frilly midnight black lace. Some exquisite pale purple cotton dress shoes with purple star patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>“Enviro readings look normal,” groaned Tammy Smith, peering down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal.</p>
<p>“Sure, normal… for a DUMP!!” droned Ms. O’James drily.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Dwight Edgmont smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was looking frumpy in an outdated maroon crinkly foil hoodie and some silver coloured leather trousers. The chartreuse nylon sneakers that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,” she drawled courageously. “I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Wallabies attacked Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>A intense battle started!</p>
<p>“BY THE METEORS OF VENUS!!!” shouted Dwight Edgmont. He drew the vibro sword out of his belt. He heaved the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a mighty power.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Wallabies with a tremendous thud.</p>
<p>The Space Wallabies went flying across the room.</p>
<p>“BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!” bellowed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her equipment bag. She lifted the Venusian Katana of Power over her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a mighty force.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Wallabies with a tremendous whack.</p>
<p>The Space Wallabies went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, stunned Space Wallabies littered the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” splurted Ms. O’James acidly. “It looked like those Space Wallabies had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their jerseys,” she drawled placidly. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” intoned Tammy Smith enigmatically.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Captain Dwight sighed enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I would have been a goner without you, Navigator Tammy,” he giggled fawningly. He was decked out in a handsome yellow dacron hoodie and some maroon denim leggings. On his feet he wore some handsome mauve nylon sandals. “Thank you, Captain Dwight,” he breathed enigmatically. “I am in debt to you, Ms. O’James,” he whispered calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Not too far away was a communications panel. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity looked around. She was looking fine in a beautiful rainbow coloured crinkly foil robe with purple and violet moon beam patterns. Her feet were shod with some pale indigo dacron pumps with dark violet lightning bolt patterns. She all of a sudden had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby pulsing red and green lights. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” yelled Dwight Edgmont. He was sporting a fine yellow crinkly foil smock. Some snappy brown rayon dress shoes graced his feet. “That was some top notch action from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he drawled calmly. “I think I should promote you to Lieutenant, Ms. O’James!” he stated firmly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James laughingly. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” stated Commander Joe virtuously. He was looking smashing in a snappy tie dyed cotton jersey and some snappy blue green rayon culottes. On his feet he wore some snappy green denim sandals with gold coloured crinkly foil trim.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” stated Captain Dwight blissfully.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a pizza after that,” breathed Tammy Smith peacefully.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Commander Joe,” drawled Serenity Starlight blissfully.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="4"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-revenge-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">5. The Revenge of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the Captain’s chair. She was looking impressive in a fantastic rainbow hued dacron halter top with shimmering rainbow hued lacy frills and some fantastic violet nylon trousers adorned with emeralds. The fantastic shiny silver crinkly foil sandals adorned with rubies she was looking fine in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” sighed Commander Joe Mulbury courageously. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the view screen.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” sighed Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her nose. She was looking frumpy in a plaid cotton trench coat. Her feet were shod in some outdated orange silk trainers. She was meticulously cleaning the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the air conditioning unit.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of thing you can just order off Omnizon, Ensign Serenity,” Navigator Tammy drawled virtuously. She surveyed the area. She held the Star Jewel of Eternity in her hand. Just then, she tripped. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“Whoopsy-daisy,” said Navigator Tammy quietly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont moved his smooth yet firm arm in the direction of Tammy Smith. His close cropped black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James gestured towards Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He put his hand up to his ugly brow.</p>
<p>“It’s Nebulon!” Navigator Tammy bellowed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wildly. He was looking villanous in a dark black silk great coat. The fine midnight black cotton dress shoes that he had on looked almost new. “We meet again, do-gooders!” he chirped with a voice like a rabid dog in a gymnasium parking lot. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made motions of shock with her hands.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury barked “OH NO!”. He was wearing a red crinkly foil jersey and some purple denim leggings with tan dacron trim. The purple leather boots with purple nylon trim that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” shouted Serenity Starlight sternly.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Dwight Edgmont is being held!” yelled Commander Joe irritatedly.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” splurted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James heavily.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” screeched Joe Mulbury gratingly. He picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He held the electro wrench in his hand. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” he barked outrageously. Out of the blue, a cooking drone buzzed by his head. “What was that?” he barked acidly. He blinked heavily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There was a torch in a thing on the wall off in the distance. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the creeps,” muttered Commander Joe drably. He was decked out in a fine plaid dacron suit jacket and some snappy pink crinkly foil trousers. Some silver coloured dacron boots were on his feet.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith dialed up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro metrics look normal,” muttered Tammy Smith drily. She was looking tastless in a maroon dacron jacket and some outdated brown silk culottes. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on her short blonde hair. On her feet she wore some black silk sneakers with a tacky green zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>“Normal, sure… for a DUMP!!” bleated Joe Mulbury heavily.</p>
<p>With a exquisite yet strong motion, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. She was decked out in a beautiful purple and white leather blouse with deep indigo moon beam patterns and some black and purple silk slacks with red and purple lacy frills. The beautiful rainbow hued crinkly foil dress shoes with white leather trim on her feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light. With a soft yet powerful motion, she lifted the bottle caps. “These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,” she shouted emphatically.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned her to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to say to you”, he said painingly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“You know, about that time in the engine room…” gasped Joe Mulbury painingly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James blushed a deep red. “Words are not necessary, Joe Mulbury” she said coyly.</p>
<p>With a soft yet strong motion, Commander Joe picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. He held the skull of a Space Rat in his hand. “This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,” he muttered slowly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ensign Serenity sighed firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage! He was looking exciting in a yellow rayon jumper and some green denim leggings. His feet were shod with some red rayon trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,” he said energetically. “Thank you, Joe Mulbury,” he breathed strongly. “I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he sighed happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. A Captain’s chair seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity looked around. She was decked out in a marvellous violet rayon great coat with frilly silver and purple lace. On her feet she wore some beautiful indigo cotton sneakers with silver and purple moon beam patterns. She all of a sudden had a funny inkling. She looked behind the nearby Captain’s chair. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont. “I saw you display some top notch action today, Ms. O’James!” he breathed blissfully. “I think I should promote you to Lieutenant, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he drawled lightly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Serenity Starlight peacefully. “I’m too modest, I like being a Ensign too!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” whispered Commander Joe peacefully. He was looking fine in a mauve polyester long coat. Some handsome tan rayon shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight slumped down on the bean bag chair. The navy blue dacron coveralls with chartreuse rayon trim he was looking exciting in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The pinstripe cotton sandals that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” breathed Tammy Smith blissfully.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Tammy Smith,” chirped Joe Mulbury enigmatically.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-star-jewel-of-eternity">6. The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a view screen off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the Captain’s chair. She was looking smashing in a black and purple crinkly foil dress with shiny purple dacron trim. Her feet were shod in some purple crinkly foil pumps with violet moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the air conditioning unit. He was sporting a handsome violet polyester jumper and some white dacron leggings. The handsome gold coloured leather shoes with chartreuse silk trim that he had on looked almost new. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he drawled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the communications panel. “Hello, Ensign Serenity,” he giggled fawningly. The snappy brown denim muscle shirt he was resplendent in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The green nylon trainers on his feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the communications panel.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Tammy Smith,” Joe Mulbury breathed obsequiously. He was intently cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Captain Dwight,” Commander Joe smiled laughingly. He surveyed the area. With a soft yet forceful motion, he lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope into the light. Suddenly, he lost his balance. He lost his grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her graceful yet firm arm in the direction of him. She was gotten up in a tasteless pinstripe silk hoodie with gaudy mauve polka dots and a bleak mauve crinkly foil skirt. Some gaudy tan leather trainers graced her feet.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his soft yet strong hand in the direction of Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James looked at Joe Mulbury. She motioned Joe Mulbury to step back from the others for a moment. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the Captain’s chair. “There’s something I need to talk to you about”, she began awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James?” asked Joe Mulbury. His short blonde hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Um, about that time in the loading bay…” muttered Serenity Starlight painfully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe went beet red with blushing. “It’s all right, Serenity Starlight, you don’t need to say anything,” he mumbled slumblingly. He picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He lifted the cup of coffee into the light. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he said laughingly. He looked around. He held the Star Jewel of Eternity in his hand. Just then, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont pointed towards Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight glanced drily at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a cleaning drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. His deep chin in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights. “What in blazes was that?” he breathed courageously. He beamed obsequiously.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a strange hunch. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” yelled Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity looked around. She all of a sudden had a strange inkling. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“There was some top notch action I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” drawled Captain Dwight placidly. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, Ms. O’James!” he stated energetically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” breathed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” whispered Commander Joe blissfully.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a hamburger right now,” said Tammy Smith lightly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Joe Mulbury,” whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">7. The Return of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A Captain’s chair gleamed in the fluorescent light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the air conditioning unit. She was looking delightful in a rainbow coloured nylon top with black and purple rayon trim and some WICKED AWESOME purple and gold dacron slacks with crimson and violet lacy frills. On her feet she wore some violet leather dress shoes with silvery star patterns. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the communications panel. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth. His handsome brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He was looking smashing in a chartreuse polyester great coat with red stripes. The handsome maroon nylon sneakers he was decked out in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the Captain’s chair. He was wearing some snappy blue denim coveralls. His feet were shod in some violet rayon trainers. He put his hand up to his deep chin. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he said peacefully.</p>

<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,” Ms. O’James drawled calmly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was cracking open pecans with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“It’s not the type of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Commander Joe,” Navigator Tammy breathed happily. Suddenly, a surveillance drone buzzed by her head. “What in Sam Hill was that?” she groaned menacingly. She frowned annoyingly. She looked around. With a supple yet masterful motion, she lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope. Just then, she stumbled. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“Whoops,” gulped Tammy Smith quietly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe moved his supple yet firm hand in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his graceful yet firm hand in the direction of Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity glanced heavily at Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” screeched Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. She was looking intimidating in a dark red leather long coat. Her overbearing mouth in profile cast a shadow against the Captain’s chair. The dark black polyester pumps that she had on looked almost new. “What have we here!” she sighed with a voice like a crazed bull piloting a helicopter. She snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith’s mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont put his hands to his cheeks in disbelief.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James made motions of shock with her hands.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Joe Mulbury!” said Navigator Tammy heavily.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” bellowed Lieutenant Serenity exasperatedly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” barked Navigator Tammy outrageously.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the star charts that were nearby. He held the star charts in his hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” he smiled placidly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was a door to the dungeon. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the chills,” said Lieutenant Serenity downheartedly. She was decked out in an elegant purple and white leather robe with purple and white lacy frills. Some WICKED AWESOME shiny silver cotton pumps with purple and white moon beam patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” smiled Captain Dwight peacefully. He was looking ready for action in a navy blue nylon hoodie and some yellow crinkly foil culottes. On his feet he wore some handsome maroon leather dress shoes with brown stripes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” mumbled Lieutenant Serenity slowly. She surveyed the area. She held the Star Jewel of Eternity in her hand. Just then, she tripped. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at her.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont glared in the direction of Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James picked up the shards of broken glass that were nearby. She lifted the shards of broken glass to eye level. “These shards of broken glass represents how I feel inside,” she muttered enigmatically. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby torch in a thing on the wall. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” shouted Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ms. O’James said energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking fine in a fine red crinkly foil jumper and some chartreuse rayon leggings. The snappy black denim shoes that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Tammy Smith,” he chirped calmly. “I would have been lost without you, Dwight Edgmont,” he giggled energetically. “I am indebted to you, Ms. O’James,” he smiled energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. A Captain’s chair seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area with her eyes. She was looking impressive in a fantastic dark indigo dacron shirt adorned with sapphires and some elegant purple dacron leggings with silver and purple cotton trim. Her feet were shod with some beautiful pale indigo nylon dress shoes with blue and purple leather trim. She all of a sudden had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont. “I saw you display some quick thinking today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he whispered obsequiously. “I think I should promote you to Lieutenant Commander, Lieutenant Serenity!” he giggled virtuously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” stated Lieutenant Serenity courageously. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she smiled placidly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a soda after that,” giggled Joe Mulbury happily.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” giggled Navigator Tammy courageously.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Tammy Smith,” said Joe Mulbury placidly. He was decked out in a blue leather suit jacket and some yellow silk culottes. Some silver coloured silk dress shoes with blue cotton trim graced his feet.</p>

<h2 id="the-scourge-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">8. The Scourge of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. In the centre of the area was an air conditioning unit. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the view screen. Her perfect forehead in profile threw a shadow on the view screen. She was looking delightful in a marvellous midnight black cotton suit jacket with dark purple moon beam patterns and an exquisite shimmering multi hued cotton skirt with crimson and purple lacy frills. On her feet she wore some fantastic rainbow coloured rayon pumps with shimmering rainbow hued star patterns.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the air conditioning unit. He was looking exciting in a navy blue leather top and some orange red rayon leggings. The fine white silk boots that were on his feet looked almost new. His close cropped black hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the Captain’s chair. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she drawled with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury motioned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James to step away from the others for a moment. He was wearing a purple denim sweater and some fine orange denim leggings with pink silk trim. His feet were shod with some gold coloured nylon sandals. “There’s something I need to say to you”, he began slowly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short blonde locks.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“Uh, about that time in the mess hall…” mumbled Joe Mulbury slowly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity went beet red with blushing. “Speak not of it, Commander Joe” she breathed slowly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He held the electro wrench in his hand. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” he giggled peacefully.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! Her overbearing mouth in profile cast a shadow against the view screen. She was wearing a black polyester sweater and some dark red nylon slacks with midnight black nylon trim. On her feet she wore some deep black crinkly foil sneakers with dark black stripes.</p>
<p>“The Skull Witch!” Joe Mulbury shouted.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. “So sorry to spoil your party, chums!” she giggled with a voice like a samurai driving a race car. She snatched Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury screamed “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>This was bad, but Captain Dwight didn’t let it affect his mood. “OH NO!” he shouted with a voice like charcoal at a baseball game.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity put her hands on the sides of her face in surprise.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts into the light. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” he sighed placidly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” yelped Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wildly. “What have we here!” she breathed with a voice like a crazed bull at a square dance. She grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont’s mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James shouted “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” bleated Ms. O’James weakly. She was sporting a beautiful pale indigo nylon jumper with frilly rainbow hued lace and an elegant purple and violet polyester skirt with dark purple lacy frills. Some fantastic multi coloured silk shoes with dark indigo lightning bolt patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>“Enviro metrics look normal,” chirped Dwight Edgmont, gazing down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a DUMP!!” intoned Lieutenant Serenity weakly. “Let’s keep moving,” she gasped downheartedly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Captain Dwight,” he drawled laughingly. He was wearing a gold coloured cotton jacket and some snappy brown cotton leggings with pinstripe stripes. On his feet he wore some silver coloured silk sandals with tie dyed dacron trim. “I would have been a goner without you, Lieutenant Serenity,” he chirped fawningly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Commander Joe screamed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. “We meet again, kiddies!” he stated with a voice like a crazed bull in a mosh pit. The fine deep black crinkly foil trench coat he was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. Some black cotton dress shoes graced his feet. His ugly brow in profile threw a shadow on the puddle of icky looking liquid. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe made motions of disbelief with his hands.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gawped wide in shock. She picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. She held the skull of a Space Rat in her hand. “This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,” she groaned gratingly. Walking along, she unexpectedly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“What the devil was that?” said Joe Mulbury exasperatedly. Walking along, he unexpectedly smacked his head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we can get through this we’ll have to find another way in!” muttered Ms. O’James irksomely. “We have a duty to rescue Captain Dwight Edgmont!” she groaned exasperatedly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Joe Mulbury said enigmatically.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage! He was looking exciting in a handsome blue green leather great coat with pinstripe dacron trim. His feet were shod with some tan denim boots.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Joe Mulbury,” he breathed firmly. “Thank you, Lieutenant Serenity,” he giggled peacefully.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ms. O’James chirped lightly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was looking completely unimpressive in a gaudy brown dacron track suit. The outdated navy blue dacron pumps that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“I would have been toast without you, Joe Mulbury,” she stated calmly. “I am in debt to you, Captain Dwight,” she whispered peacefully. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight,” she breathed virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“There was some top notch action from you today, Serenity Starlight!” chirped Dwight Edgmont energetically. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Ms. O’James!” he chirped happily.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” breathed Ms. O’James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was decked out in a marvellous black and purple crinkly foil jumper with frilly deep violet lace and some fantastic blue and purple dacron slacks with pale violet lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod in some exquisite silvery nylon boots with shiny purple lacy frills. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” she giggled placidly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury slumped down on the sofa. He was wearing a chartreuse crinkly foil suit jacket and some silver coloured leather trousers. Some handsome plaid denim dress shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” sighed Captain Dwight obsequiously.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="8"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-chalice-of-dreams">9. The Chalice of Dreams</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A Captain’s chair seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the view screen. She was decked out in a marvellous shiny purple silk trench coat adorned with emeralds. On her feet she wore some exquisite deep violet dacron pixie boots with frilly purple and white lace.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are plum out of nutri worms,” breathed Navigator Tammy Smith peacefully. She was intently buffing the Chalice of Dreams. She was gotten up in a green rayon sweater and some outdated white silk trousers with gaudy navy blue polka dots. The plaid cotton pumps that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Commander Joe Mulbury. He was looking impressive in a red denim jersey and some blue rayon leggings. Some tie dyed silk trainers graced his feet.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of thing you can just order off Omnizon, Joe Mulbury,” Navigator Tammy giggled courageously.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was meticulously polishing the Saturnian Orb of Hope. His handsome brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,” Joe Mulbury chirped enigmatically.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a courier drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. His close cropped black hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. “What in the world was that?” he chirped virtuously. He was wearing a white denim long coat. His feet were shod with some white silk sandals. He grinned placidly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked around. He lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope. Without warning, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” whispered Joe Mulbury quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy gestured towards him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glared in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity moved her supple yet firm arm in the direction of Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a messenger drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What was that?” he stated calmly. He beamed enigmatically.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned Lieutenant Serenity to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I wanted to talk to you about”, he sighed coyly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Lieutenant Serenity.</p>
<p>“Well, about that time in the engine room…” mumbled Joe Mulbury painingly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James blushed a deep red. “Speak not of it, Joe Mulbury” she sighed awkwardly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith surveyed the area. With a graceful yet forceful motion, she lifted the Chalice of Dreams. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead. All of a sudden, she stumbled. She lost her grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith’s face.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glanced enigmatically at Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James gestured towards Navigator Tammy. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a inkling. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” shouted Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby Captain’s chair. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” exclaimed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“You displayed some top notch action today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” smiled Dwight Edgmont happily. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he drawled strongly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” breathed Ms. O’James energetically. “I’m too modest, I like being a Lieutenant too!”. “I could really go for a curry after that,” she drawled firmly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” whispered Commander Joe fawningly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Commander Joe,” whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James peacefully.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="9"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-chalice-of-dreams">10. The Return of The Chalice of Dreams</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a navigation dashboard off in the corner. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the pantry and it looks like we are plum out of eggs,” sighed Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James happily. She was decked out in an exquisite deep violet dacron blouse adorned with sapphires and some marvellous violet leather leggings with indigo lacy frills. The WICKED AWESOME silver and purple polyester sandals with deep indigo dacron trim that she had on looked almost new. Her perfect forehead seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the air conditioning unit.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” sighed Captain Dwight Edgmont obsequiously. The gold coloured dacron jumpsuit he was resplendent in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. On his feet he wore some snappy floral print dacron trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the communications panel.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was cracking open pecans with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his close cropped black hair.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Dwight Edgmont,” Ms. O’James chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>With a soft yet masterful motion, Commander Joe gestured to her to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I wanted to talk about”, he gasped coyly. His short blonde hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Lieutenant Serenity.</p>
<p>“You know, about the other day in the engine room…” mumbled Joe Mulbury coyly. He was decked out in a pinstripe nylon jerkin and some pinstripe dacron culottes. His feet were shod with some violet polyester sandals.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went beet red with blushing. “Words are not necessary, Joe Mulbury” she gulped awkwardly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a messenger drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What in Sam Hill was that?” he stated placidly. He whistled fawningly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. Just then, she tripped. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Drat,” breathed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith moved her graceful yet firm arm in the direction of her. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead. She was looking completely unimpressive in an outdated orange red polyester suit jacket and some green crinkly foil leggings. On her feet she wore some tacky pinstripe nylon boots.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked at Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>With a gentle yet firm motion, Dwight Edgmont pointed towards Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” screeched Lieutenant Serenity.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. “So sorry to spoil your little party, kiddies!” he drawled with a voice like a giraffe in a rainstorm. He was wearing a handsome deep red leather jerkin and some deep black denim culottes. His ugly brow in profile threw a shadow on the Captain’s chair. Some midnight black dacron shoes were on his feet. He grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith clapped her hands to the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” exclaimed Captain Dwight lightly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James put her hands on her cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Commander Joe is being held!” splurted Navigator Tammy emphatically.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James viciously.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” barked Navigator Tammy threateningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. Nearby were some manacles. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” intoned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James exasperatedly. She was sporting a shiny silver dacron suit jacket adorned with emeralds and some elegant multi hued dacron leggings adorned with sapphires. The exquisite black and purple dacron pixie boots with frilly dark purple lace that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Enviro measurements look normal,” whispered Dwight Edgmont, looking down at his hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. The brown leather jersey with tie dyed stripes he was looking ready for action in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. On his feet he wore some handsome orange silk shoes.</p>
<p>“… For a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” said Ms. O’James enigmatically.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James were attacked by some Space Snails.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gritted his teeth and determined to stay upbeat.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle had begun!</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, stunned Space Snails littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” stated Dwight Edgmont obsequiously. “It looked like those Space Snails had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their armor,” he said fawningly. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” bleated Navigator Tammy grumpily. “Let’s keep moving,” she groaned exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in a plaid cotton smock. Some purple polyester dress shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I would have been toast without you, Navigator Tammy,” he sighed fawningly. “I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,” he sighed obsequiously. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight,” he sighed placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. A communications panel gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area with her eyes. She was wearing a marvellous purple and violet silk smock with silvery star patterns. Her feet were shod in some purple and gold denim sneakers with silver and purple lightning bolt patterns. She suddenly had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby Captain’s chair. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Commander Joe. He was looking smashing in a handsome tan polyester trench coat. The tan dacron sneakers with plaid crinkly foil trim that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“There was some top notch thinking from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” smiled Captain Dwight strongly. “I think I should promote you to Lieutenant Commander, Serenity Starlight!” he breathed happily. He was sporting a snappy pinstripe rayon track suit. The handsome tie dyed polyester shoes with tie dyed stripes on his feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” stated Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. “I’m too modest, I like being a Lieutenant too!”. “I could really go for a curry after that,” she whispered calmly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” breathed Commander Joe placidly.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” stated Captain Dwight firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy slumped down on the couch. She was looking frumpy in a red crinkly foil leotard. The gaudy violet denim sneakers with a tacky orange red zig zag pattern she was looking tastless in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. “Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Lieutenant Serenity,” she drawled enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="10"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-skull-witch">11. The Return of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. Not too far away was a navigation dashboard. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. The elegant shimmering rainbow coloured nylon smock with purple and gold crinkly foil trim she was looking fine in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some marvellous dark indigo denim dress shoes with indigo lightning bolt patterns. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight,” stated Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his ears. He was looking delightful in a tie dyed rayon hoodie and some orange dacron leggings. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the Captain’s chair. Some brown leather shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” drawled Captain Dwight Edgmont courageously.</p>
<p>“Hello, Captain Dwight,” whispered Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her nose. She was looking frumpy in a plaid crinkly foil shirt and some silver coloured rayon leggings. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead. The blue nylon pumps that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight was cracking open pecans with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Dwight Edgmont. His close cropped black hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. He was looking ready for action in a handsome floral print nylon long coat with red nylon trim. His feet were shod in some tie dyed silk sneakers with tie dyed dacron trim.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Captain Dwight,” Serenity Starlight breathed strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was meticulously buffing the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Lieutenant Serenity,” Tammy Smith breathed virtuously. She surveyed the area with her eyes. With a smooth yet masterful motion, she lifted the Venusian Staff of Power. Without warning, she stubbed her toe. She lost her grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith’s face.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his supple yet forceful hand in the direction of Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James pointed towards Tammy Smith. She picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She held the electro wrench in her hand. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” she bleated sadly.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“The Skull Witch!” Serenity Starlight barked.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. “I have you now!” she sighed with a voice like a tiger driving a race car. She snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. She was looking impressive in a blood red nylon halter top and some handsome blood coloured crinkly foil culottes. The dark red crinkly foil shoes that she had on looked almost new. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of disbelief with her hands.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight cried “OH NO!”.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gaped wide in surprise. She picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she barked gratingly.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a cooking drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith’s head. “What was that?” she bellowed emphatically. She blinked exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. There was a torch in a thing on the wall off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” bleated Ms. O’James heavily. She was wearing a WICKED AWESOME deep indigo leather top with frilly silvery lace and some beautiful red and purple cotton trousers with purple star patterns. On her feet she wore some exquisite multi coloured silk pixie boots with crimson star patterns.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont launched the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro metrics look normal,” smiled Captain Dwight enigmatically.</p>
<p>“… For a DISASTER AREA!!” muttered Lieutenant Serenity weakly. She looked around. With a soft yet strong motion, she lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope to eye level. Just then, she lost her balance. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“Oopsie-daisy,” breathed Ms. O’James quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her exquisite yet masterful arm in the direction of her. She was wearing an outdated chartreuse polyester tank top with gaudy floral print polka dots and some tie dyed leather leggings. Some floral print leather sandals graced her feet.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his smooth yet forceful arm in the direction of Lieutenant Serenity. He was looking ready for action in a blue denim jersey and some blue polyester slacks. His feet were shod with some brown crinkly foil shoes.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“What was that noise?” gasped Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Without warning, with a tremendous crash, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight stood frozen like a deer in headlights. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” screeched Navigator Tammy with a voice like a gorilla in a snowstorm.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” screeched Lieutenant Serenity with a voice like an elephant at a baseball game.</p>
<p>“We must hurry!” Tammy Smith gasped. She helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity wasted no time. She helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,” said Captain Dwight blissfully. “I would have been lost without you, Ms. O’James,” he giggled courageously.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity looked around. She all of a sudden had a strange inkling. She looked behind the nearby manacles. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” yelped Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Lieutenant Serenity drawled peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,” he smiled courageously. “Thank you, Captain Dwight,” he chirped energetically. “I would have been lost without you, Ms. O’James,” he sighed fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. A navigation dashboard gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity surveyed the area. She was looking impressive in a beautiful shimmering purple cotton jumper with purple and gold lacy frills and some fantastic shimmering purple dacron culottes with purple and white moon beam patterns. On her feet she wore some fantastic purple and white denim dress shoes with pale purple star patterns. She suddenly had a odd intuition. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelled Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some ace action today, Lieutenant Serenity!” breathed Dwight Edgmont strongly. He was looking ready for action in a fine pinstripe rayon long coat with silver coloured stripes. The blue nylon trainers that he had on looked almost new. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Lieutenant Serenity!” he chirped courageously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Lieutenant Serenity blissfully. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury flumped down on the sofa. He was looking impressive in a handsome plaid rayon jumper and some plaid crinkly foil leggings. His feet were shod with some snappy maroon nylon dress shoes with tie dyed denim trim.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” breathed Captain Dwight firmly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” smiled Tammy Smith courageously.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Tammy Smith,” sighed Dwight Edgmont blissfully.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. There was a Captain’s chair off in the distance. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the Captain’s chair. She was looking delightful in a deep indigo denim shirt with pale indigo moon beam patterns and some fantastic crimson and violet rayon trousers with shiny silver lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod with some marvellous violet crinkly foil dress shoes with deep violet lacy frills.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. He put his hand up to his handsome brow. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he stated with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the navigation dashboard. He was sporting a blue green silk jumper and some gold coloured denim culottes. His feet were shod in some chartreuse denim dress shoes. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he sighed peacefully.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” chirped Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her ears. She was looking tastless in a plaid denim leotard with a tacky maroon zig zag pattern. On her feet she wore some chartreuse leather trainers.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was cracking open pecans with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Navigator Tammy,” Captain Dwight stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>With a graceful yet confident motion, Joe Mulbury motioned Ms. O’James to step aside from the others for a moment. He was looking delightful in a silver coloured leather sweater and some handsome tan polyester slacks with blue stripes. The handsome gold coloured polyester shoes with floral print stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. “There’s something I wanted to say to you”, he mumbled coyly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“Um, about that time in the mess hall…” whispered Joe Mulbury slumblingly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James blushed a deep red. “Hush, Commander Joe, there’s no need, you know that,” she gasped slowly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the Captain’s chair. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she chirped calmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a surveillance drone buzzed by Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What in Sam Hill was that?” she raged acidly. Her perfect forehead in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard. She grimaced firmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! Her overbearing mouth seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. She was wearing a handsome midnight black silk frock and some black polyester culottes. Some fine black rayon shoes graced her feet.</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Ms. O’James shouted.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled disdainfully. “So sorry to spoil your little party, do-gooders!” she breathed with a voice like a giraffe in a pet shop. She grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury made gestures of surprise with his arms.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight exclaimed “OH NO!”.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight put her hands to her cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Tammy Smith!” groaned Commander Joe menacingly.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” barked Serenity Starlight heavily.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” bellowed Joe Mulbury viciously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. A door to the dungeon gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” intoned Serenity Starlight grumpily. She was decked out in a fantastic purple and white denim jerkin with shiny purple silk trim and some marvellous shimmering multi hued rayon culottes with dark purple lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod in some red and purple cotton pixie boots with frilly shimmering rainbow hued lace.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro measurements look normal,” giggled Dwight Edgmont blissfully. He was resplendent in an orange red rayon great coat. The black nylon shoes with chartreuse rayon trim that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a PIT!!” droned Serenity Starlight drily.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked around. He lifted the Chalice of Dreams to eye level. Just then, he lost his balance. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of his grip.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Oopsie-daisy,” sighed Captain Dwight quietly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked at him.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity glanced irritatedly at Dwight Edgmont. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby door to the dungeon. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont. His close cropped black hair seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ms. O’James smiled laughingly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was looking frumpy in an ill fitting brown dacron jumper and some outdated white rayon culottes with a tacky orange red zig zag pattern. On her feet she wore some tasteless green denim trainers.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Commander Joe,” she drawled peacefully. “I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,” she stated placidly. “I would have been lost without you, Ms. O’James,” she said firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“You displayed some ace thinking today, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!” drawled Dwight Edgmont happily. “I think I should promote you to Commander, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!” he breathed blissfully. He was resplendent in a handsome white dacron trench coat with red stripes. Some maroon rayon sandals with chartreuse stripes were on his feet.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” sighed Ms. O’James strongly. She was looking smashing in an elegant red and purple denim jacket adorned with emeralds and some fantastic deep violet denim slacks with frilly shiny silver lace. Her feet were shod in some beautiful silver coloured rayon boots with dark purple lacy frills. “I’m too modest, I like being a Lieutenant Commander too!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a pizza after that,” breathed Commander Joe energetically.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” chirped Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” drawled Tammy Smith happily. She was looking completely unimpressive in a black dacron halter top and some purple crinkly foil trousers. Some tacky chartreuse denim pumps graced her feet. “Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Captain Dwight,” she stated blissfully.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="12"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-scourge-of-the-skull-witch">13. The Scourge of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. In the centre of the area was a communications panel. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of Space Sugar,” giggled Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James placidly. She was decked out in a beautiful red and purple leather jacket with blue and purple lacy frills and an elegant crimson and purple cotton skirt with frilly purple and white lace. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued locks. The fantastic purple and violet cotton pixie boots with shimmering multi hued moon beam patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the view screen. He was looking fine in a brown polyester track suit. On his feet he wore some orange leather shoes. “Hello, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,” he drawled firmly. His handsome brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the view screen. His deep chin in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights. He was sporting an orange red nylon trench coat. The fine mauve polyester boots on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the communications panel.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was wearing a dark black silk jersey with dark red stripes and some dark black denim trousers. Her feet were shod in some blood coloured cotton pixie boots.</p>
<p>“YOU!” yelped Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. “I have you now!” she giggled with a voice like charcoal in a mosh pit. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. Her long green hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth opened wide in shock.</p>
<p>“NOOO!” yelled Dwight Edgmont obsequiously.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth opened wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts into the light. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” he stated energetically.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a security drone buzzed by Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What the devil was that?” she intoned icily. She grimaced emphatically.</p>
<p>With a gentle yet strong motion, Joe Mulbury motioned her to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk about”, he breathed slowly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“Uh, about last night in the mess hall…” said Commander Joe carefully.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight blushed a deep red. “It’s all right, Commander Joe, you don’t need to say anything,” she mumbled painfully. Suddenly, a messenger drone flew close by her head. “What the devil was that?” she shouted firmly. She frowned threateningly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the chills,” gasped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James drily. She was wearing a blue and purple dacron smock with shimmering rainbow hued nylon trim. The elegant shimmering rainbow hued polyester dress shoes with pale purple lacy frills that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Enviro measurements look normal,” said Joe Mulbury, looking down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>“Normal, sure… for a PIT!!” droned Lieutenant Commander Serenity exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Ferrets attacked Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>A fierce skirmish began!</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James ran to the side, looking to attack them from behind. She wasn’t looking where she was going and bumped into Joe Mulbury in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glanced enigmatically at her.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James went beet red with blushing.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Commander Joe rushed back into the fight. He was looking smashing in a yellow nylon jerkin and some floral print denim leggings with white dacron trim. On his feet he wore some snappy blue green denim trainers.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James sprinted to the side, looking to attack the Space Ferrets from the rear. She wasn’t watching where she was going and bumped into Commander Joe in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked at her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James blushed a deep red.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Joe Mulbury rushed back into the melee. “BY THE MOONS OF NEPTUNE!!!” he screeched. He drew the Jovian battle axe out of his backpack. He heaved the Jovian battle axe over his head. He brought down the Jovian battle axe with a awesome power.</p>
<p>The Jovian battle axe made contact with the Space Ferrets with a tremendous thud.</p>
<p>The Space Ferrets went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, dazed Space Ferrets littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” groaned Ms. O’James slumblingly.</p>
<p>“It looked like those Space Ferrets had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their clothes,” smiled Commander Joe laughingly. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” bleated Serenity Starlight drily. “Let’s keep moving,” she gulped weakly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was looking tastless in a tacky brown dacron top and some outdated floral print leather culottes. Some pinstripe rayon sandals with gaudy blue green polka dots were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“I would have been a goner without you, Joe Mulbury,” she sighed courageously. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead. “I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,” she said calmly. “Thank you, Ms. O’James,” she drawled fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>“That was some top notch thinking I saw from you today, Ms. O’James!” drawled Captain Dwight peacefully. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commander, Serenity Starlight!” he sighed happily.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” breathed Lieutenant Commander Serenity, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was looking impressive in a silver and purple silk suit jacket with dark purple dacron trim and some fantastic violet nylon slacks adorned with sapphires. Some elegant pale purple denim shoes with frilly violet lace graced her feet. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a hamburger right now,” said Joe Mulbury enigmatically.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight flumped down on the sofa. He was looking exciting in a silver coloured silk muscle shirt and some navy blue silk slacks with plaid stripes. The blue green polyester sneakers he was looking exciting in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet confident motion, Tammy Smith slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="13"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-menace-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">14. The Menace of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a communications panel off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the air conditioning unit. She was looking fine in a beautiful dark purple nylon trench coat with frilly red and purple lace. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. The elegant deep indigo cotton sneakers with multi coloured star patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the view screen. He was resplendent in an orange leather hoodie and some tie dyed crinkly foil culottes. On his feet he wore some fine plaid cotton sandals with orange denim trim. He put his hand up to his deep chin. He was cracking open pecans with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“It’s not the type of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Navigator Tammy,” Dwight Edgmont said happily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a security drone flew close by Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What in Sam Hill was that?” she said firmly. She blinked threateningly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury motioned her to step away from the others for a moment. He was looking delightful in a handsome orange red cotton jumpsuit. His feet were shod with some fine white polyester sandals with blue nylon trim. “There’s a thing I wanted to talk about”, he began painfully.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>“You know, about last night in the loading bay…” sighed Joe Mulbury slowly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight went beet red with blushing. “Hush, Joe Mulbury, there’s no need, you know that,” she breathed enigmatically.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” barked Tammy Smith. She was wearing a silver coloured denim halter top and some violet polyester trousers. Some gaudy orange leather sandals with a tacky mauve zig zag pattern were on her feet.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. “What have we here!” she said with a voice like a rabid dog in a bazaar. She snatched Commander Joe from behind. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her long green hair. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of shock with her hands.</p>
<p>This was bad, but Dwight Edgmont didn’t let it cramp his style. He clapped his hands on the sides of his face in surprise.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity screeched “NOOO!”. She picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she intoned irritatedly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight looked around. He lifted the Venusian Staff of Power to eye level. All of a sudden, he tripped. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” drawled Captain Dwight quietly.</p>
<p>With a gentle yet confident motion, Tammy Smith pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James moved her soft yet confident arm in the direction of Dwight Edgmont. She surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a odd hunch. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. Nearby was a torch in a thing on the wall. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” said Navigator Tammy weakly. The ill fitting plaid cotton jerkin with gaudy orange red polka dots she was gotten up in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. On her feet she wore some white dacron boots.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet firm motion, Ms. O’James dialed up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” smiled Lieutenant Commander Serenity strongly. The exquisite blue and purple nylon suit jacket with frilly white lace she was decked out in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. The shimmering purple leather boots with silver and purple moon beam patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” bleated Navigator Tammy slowly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! The black nylon coveralls he was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. His ugly brow in profile threw a shadow on the puddle of icky looking liquid. His feet were shod in some handsome midnight black rayon shoes.</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Lieutenant Commander Serenity bellowed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. “We meet again, kiddies!” he giggled with a voice like a gangster in a video arcade. He grabbed Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of surprise with her arms.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity yelled “Nooooooooooooo!”. She picked up the shards of broken glass that were nearby. She held the shards of broken glass in her hand. “These shards of broken glass represents how I feel inside,” she yelled irritatedly. Walking along, she suddenly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“What in blazes was that?” splurted Navigator Tammy drily. Walking along, she surprisedly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we can get through this we’ll have to find another way in!” gulped Lieutenant Commander Serenity drily. “We have a duty to rescue Captain Dwight Edgmont!” she mumbled grumpily. “Let’s keep moving,” she mumbled exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Navigator Tammy,” he breathed laughingly. He was looking exciting in a blue green polyester muscle shirt with maroon stripes and some chartreuse denim trousers. His feet were shod with some plaid cotton boots. “I would have been a goner without you, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,” he stated laughingly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Navigator Tammy stated blissfully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! His handsome brow in profile cast a shadow against the puddle of icky looking liquid.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he giggled firmly. “I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,” he drawled placidly. He was decked out in a tan silk hoodie and some floral print dacron trousers with gold coloured stripes. Some handsome black leather sneakers were on his feet. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight,” he giggled lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the distance. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some ace thinking today, Ms. O’James!” whispered Dwight Edgmont energetically. He was resplendent in a snappy navy blue dacron jerkin and some orange dacron culottes. On his feet he wore some handsome violet polyester dress shoes. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commander, Serenity Starlight!” he said firmly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” chirped Ms. O’James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was looking smashing in an elegant multi hued nylon trench coat with multi hued lacy frills. The exquisite crimson and purple silk boots with indigo lacy frills that were on her feet looked almost new. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” said Commander Joe fawningly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a soda after that,” whispered Dwight Edgmont lightly.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” giggled Navigator Tammy firmly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Dwight Edgmont,” whispered Ms. O’James firmly.</p>

<h2 id="the-menace-of-the-skull-witch">15. The Menace of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. A Captain’s chair gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. Her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She was sporting an exquisite blue and purple cotton sweater with crimson lightning bolt patterns and some fantastic shiny silver nylon leggings with purple lacy frills. Some fantastic crimson nylon shoes adorned with emeralds graced her feet.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” breathed Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the Captain’s chair.</p>
<p>“Hello, Captain Dwight,” drawled Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth. She was meticulously polishing the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Joe Mulbury. His handsome brow seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Commander Joe,” Navigator Tammy whispered blissfully.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was cracking open walnuts with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Commander Joe,” Dwight Edgmont said laughingly.</p>
<p>With a exquisite yet strong motion, Tammy Smith picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She lifted the electro wrench. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her short blonde hair. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” she said happily. She was gotten up in a gold coloured silk robe. On her feet she wore some tacky blue cotton pixie boots.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked around. He was looking exciting in some black cotton coveralls with blue green leather trim. The fine navy blue cotton sandals that he had on looked almost new. He held the Star Jewel of Eternity in his hand. His deep chin in profile threw a shadow on the Captain’s chair. Suddenly, he lost his balance. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of his grip.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont’s face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glared in the direction of Dwight Edgmont. He was wearing an orange denim sweater and some brown denim slacks. His feet were shod in some handsome navy blue silk trainers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James glanced exasperatedly at Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! The fine red rayon shirt she was looking intimidating in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod in some deep red rayon pumps.</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” shouted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. “I have you now!” she giggled with a voice like a baboon in a pet shop. She snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith’s mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hands to his cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>“NOOO!” shouted Serenity Starlight with a voice like a giraffe in a video arcade.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Captain Dwight!” yelled Tammy Smith gratingly.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” bellowed Serenity Starlight outrageously.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” barked Navigator Tammy sternly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She lifted the cup of coffee. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she groaned emphatically.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. In the centre of the area was a door to the dungeon. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” gulped Joe Mulbury drably.</p>
<p>“Enviro measurements look normal,” gulped Lieutenant Commander Serenity, gazing down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. She was decked out in an elegant deep violet leather frock with silvery polyester trim and an elegant purple rayon skirt with rainbow hued moon beam patterns. Some pale indigo denim trainers adorned with emeralds were on her feet.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” bleated Joe Mulbury drily. He was looking smashing in a purple dacron trench coat. On his feet he wore some tie dyed leather trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy surveyed the area with her eyes. She was gotten up in a navy blue nylon sweater and some tan crinkly foil trousers. The green crinkly foil boots that she had on looked almost new. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. Just then, she stumbled. She lost her grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith’s face.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked at Tammy Smith. She gestured to Commander Joe to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I wanted to talk about”, she began painfully.</p>
<p>“What is it, Serenity Starlight?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Well, about that time in the loading bay…” gasped Serenity Starlight painfully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe blushed a deep red. “Words are not necessary, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James” he said awkwardly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity looked around. She suddenly had a strange hunch. She looked behind the nearby torch in a thing on the wall. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” shouted Navigator Tammy. “Let’s keep moving,” she whispered lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>

<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“I would have been toast without you, Navigator Tammy,” he whispered blissfully. “I am indebted to you, Joe Mulbury,” he breathed fawningly. “Thank you, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,” he smiled energetically. He was resplendent in a snappy green cotton long coat. His feet were shod in some gold coloured crinkly foil shoes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. A navigation dashboard seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James surveyed the area. She was decked out in a marvellous silver and purple dacron long coat with multi coloured lightning bolt patterns. Some midnight black denim trainers with shimmering purple leather trim graced her feet. She all of a sudden had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby pulsing red and green lights. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont. He was wearing a fine silver coloured dacron smock. The handsome mauve silk dress shoes that were on his feet looked almost new. “There was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!” he stated placidly. “I think I should promote you to Commander, Serenity Starlight!” he whispered enigmatically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” chirped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James placidly. “I’m too modest, I like being a Lieutenant Commander too!”. She flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a parmo right now,” whispered Joe Mulbury placidly.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” giggled Captain Dwight blissfully.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” whispered Tammy Smith energetically. She was looking tastless in a pinstripe rayon long coat. The gaudy tan cotton sandals on her feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Captain Dwight,” said Commander Joe laughingly. He was looking delightful in a red cotton jersey with violet stripes and some navy blue cotton culottes. On his feet he wore some silver coloured nylon dress shoes.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-saturnian-orb-of-hope">16. The Return of The Saturnian Orb of Hope</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was a Captain’s chair. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the air conditioning unit. She was looking delightful in an exquisite silver and purple polyester jerkin with pale violet lightning bolt patterns and an elegant dark indigo silk skirt with deep indigo star patterns. On her feet she wore some fantastic shimmering multi hued denim boots with pale indigo star patterns.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” said Commander Joe Mulbury energetically.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the pantry and it looks like we are fresh out of nutri worms,” smiled Captain Dwight Edgmont strongly. His deep chin seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he drawled placidly. He was sporting a mauve polyester shirt and some silver coloured crinkly foil slacks. Some orange red denim sneakers with violet denim trim were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the pulsing red and green lights.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity was intently cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy. She was wearing a gold coloured polyester frock and some violet polyester leggings. Her feet were shod with some pink dacron pumps with a tacky plaid zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>“It’s not the sort of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Tammy Smith,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James breathed happily. Suddenly, a courier drone flew close by her head. “What the devil was that?” she yelled impatiently. She frowned drily. She looked around. She held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in her hand. Just then, she was distracted. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Whoopsy-daisy,” muttered Serenity Starlight quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glanced grumpily at Lieutenant Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont glared in the direction of Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was wearing some black rayon coveralls. The blood coloured rayon sneakers with blood coloured crinkly foil trim that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“It’s Nebulon!” Commander Joe barked.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. His shoulder length green hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. “We meet again, do-gooders!” he sighed with a voice like a giraffe in a gymnasium parking lot. He grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth gaped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont yelled “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” barked Serenity Starlight acidly. She put her hand up to her perfect forehead.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Tammy Smith is being held!” barked Joe Mulbury irritatedly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short blonde hair.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” shouted Lieutenant Commander Serenity exasperatedly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” barked Commander Joe gratingly. He was wearing a handsome floral print cotton jumper and some fine chartreuse dacron culottes. His feet were shod with some green nylon boots.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She lifted the cup of coffee. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she he shoutedavily.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A torch in a thing on the wall gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” gulped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James weakly. She was looking smashing in an exquisite blue and purple nylon jerkin with black and purple moon beam patterns and a fantastic purple and white rayon skirt with shimmering rainbow coloured nylon trim. Some elegant purple silk sneakers with rainbow hued moon beam patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont opened up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” smiled Dwight Edgmont blissfully. He was wearing a yellow dacron muscle shirt with floral print rayon trim and some fine maroon cotton leggings. The handsome pink polyester trainers that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a DUMP!!” bleated Lieutenant Commander Serenity irksomely.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“Did you hear something?” Dwight Edgmont smiled.</p>
<p>Too quickly for anyone to react, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury stood frozen like a deer in headlights. The fine gold coloured cotton top he was sporting seemed to glow in the dim torch light. On his feet he wore some snappy gold coloured dacron trainers with yellow stripes. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont made gestures of surprise with his hands.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight put her hands on her cheeks in disbelief.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James were attacked by some Space Ostriches.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle ensued!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, stunned Space Ostriches were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” raged Serenity Starlight enigmatically.</p>
<p>“It looked like those Space Ostriches had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their jerseys,” chirped Captain Dwight lightly. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” gulped Lieutenant Commander Serenity heavily.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to lose!” Dwight Edgmont squealed. He helped dig Joe Mulbury out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“We must act quickly!” Lieutenant Commander Serenity gulped. She helped dig Joe Mulbury out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“I would have been toast without you, Dwight Edgmont,” drawled Commander Joe happily. “I would have been toast without you, Ms. O’James,” he stated firmly. He gestured to Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk to you about”, he groaned coyly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“Well, about that time in the engine room…” groaned Joe Mulbury slowly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James went beet red with blushing. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury’s lips.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Dwight Edgmont smiled happily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Commander Joe,” she smiled calmly. She was gotten up in an ill fitting maroon denim long coat. Her feet were shod with some tan leather sandals. “I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,” she smiled enigmatically. “I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she breathed firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. There was an air conditioning unit off in the distance. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area. The marvellous gold coloured dacron hoodie with blue and purple lacy frills she was looking fine in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some pale indigo nylon sneakers with purple dacron trim. She all of a sudden had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelled Navigator Tammy. She was looking completely unimpressive in a plaid polyester top and some yellow polyester leggings with gaudy floral print polka dots. The mauve polyester pixie boots with gaudy purple polka dots that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“There was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight!” stated Dwight Edgmont laughingly. He was wearing a yellow leather jumper and some handsome pink cotton leggings. Some tie dyed crinkly foil dress shoes graced his feet. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commander, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!” he giggled placidly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Serenity Starlight calmly. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” sighed Joe Mulbury enigmatically. He was looking fine in a maroon dacron sweater and some tan rayon slacks. His feet were shod with some tie dyed dacron trainers.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a curry right now,” breathed Captain Dwight calmly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Ms. O’James,” chirped Dwight Edgmont courageously.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="16"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-space-wallabies">17. The Space Wallabies</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A communications panel gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the communications panel. She was looking impressive in a fantastic purple and violet nylon long coat with frilly pale violet lace. Some exquisite rainbow coloured polyester sandals with frilly blue and purple lace were on her feet.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” drawled Captain Dwight Edgmont peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. She was looking tastless in a tacky navy blue cotton suit jacket and some mauve leather leggings. The floral print silk sandals with gaudy floral print polka dots that were on her feet looked almost new. She was meticulously cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“It’s not the sort of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Serenity Starlight,” Navigator Tammy smiled courageously.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was wearing a deep red polyester sweater and some fine dark red crinkly foil culottes. His feet were shod with some deep red leather trainers. His ugly brow in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>“YOU!” bellowed Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. “So sorry to spoil your little party, do-gooders!” he stated with a voice like a giraffe in a pet shop. He grabbed Commander Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy screeched “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont’s mouth gawped wide in shock. He put his hand up to his deep chin. He was looking exciting in a handsome mauve leather shirt and some snappy chartreuse cotton leggings. On his feet he wore some snappy blue crinkly foil trainers with orange stripes.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James put her hands to the sides of her face in surprise. She picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. Her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. She lifted the electro wrench. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” she splurted drily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a security drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What the devil was that?” he smiled obsequiously. He whistled placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy surveyed the area with her eyes. She lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope into the light. Suddenly, she stumbled. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Whoops,” sighed Tammy Smith quietly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont gritted his teeth and determined to stay upbeat. He glared in the direction of Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James glared in the direction of Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she said carefully.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity looked around. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” exclaimed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was a torch in a thing on the wall. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” droned Tammy Smith grumpily. She was looking frumpy in a tacky brown denim blouse with gaudy tan polka dots and some ill fitting yellow denim leggings. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on her short blonde locks. The silver coloured silk trainers that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Enviro metrics look normal,” drawled Dwight Edgmont, looking down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>“… For a DISASTER AREA!!” intoned Tammy Smith irksomely.</p>
<p>Walking along, Commander Serenity suddenly bonked her head against an invisible force field. She was looking impressive in a shimmering rainbow coloured silk great coat with pale indigo polyester trim. Some marvellous midnight black silk trainers with shimmering rainbow coloured lightning bolt patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>“What the devil was that?” droned Tammy Smith sadly. Walking along, she suddenly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we can get through this we’ll have to find another way in!” bleated Serenity Starlight heavily. “We have a duty to rescue Commander Joe Mulbury!” she said slowly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The wasteland was a sight to behold. A foundation of a ruined building seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the chills,” muttered Tammy Smith drily.</p>
<p>“Enviro measurements look normal,” muttered Serenity Starlight, looking down at her hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. The crimson and violet rayon jumpsuit with frilly red and purple lace she was sporting seemed to gleam in the harsh sun light. The elegant purple and gold cotton sandals with frilly purple and white lace she was wearing seemed to gleam in the harsh sun light.</p>
<p>“… For a DISASTER AREA!!” droned Tammy Smith enigmatically. She was looking completely unimpressive in a tasteless orange red nylon jersey and a chartreuse polyester skirt with a tacky violet zig zag pattern. Her feet were shod with some yellow silk boots.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Wallabies came around the corner.</p>
<p>“Space Wallabies!” hissed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“Kdco ytslawq rwahfm dgb fsjxirnf!!!” shouted the Space Wallabies in their strange Space Wallabie language.</p>
<p>A intense skirmish ensued!</p>
<p>“BY THE METEORS OF VENUS!!!” yelped Dwight Edgmont. He drew the vibro sword out of his belt. He was sporting a chartreuse cotton jersey with maroon denim trim and some silver coloured nylon leggings. On his feet he wore some fine violet rayon boots. He raised the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a tremendous force.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Wallabies with a mighty whack.</p>
<p>The Space Wallabies went flying across the room.</p>
<p>“BY THE METEORS OF VENUS!!!” squealed Captain Dwight. He drew the vibro sword out of his equipment bag. He raised the vibro sword over his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a awesome power.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Wallabies with a awesome thud.</p>
<p>The Space Wallabies went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, stunned Space Wallabies were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” breathed Captain Dwight laughingly. “It looked like those Space Wallabies had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their armor,” he breathed energetically. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” gulped Navigator Tammy irksomely.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There was a puddle of icky looking liquid off in the corner. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Serenity Starlight sighed obsequiously. She was looking smashing in some fantastic purple and white crinkly foil coveralls with pale violet star patterns. Her feet were shod with some marvellous pale violet silk shoes with shimmering rainbow hued star patterns.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the door to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he giggled laughingly. “I am in debt to you, Captain Dwight,” he said blissfully. “I am indebted to you, Commander Serenity,” he sighed courageously. He was looking fine in a tie dyed cotton jumpsuit. Some orange leather trainers were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. A communications panel seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“You displayed some quick thinking today, Serenity Starlight!” giggled Captain Dwight enigmatically. “I think I should promote you to Captain, Serenity Starlight!” he giggled happily. He was looking exciting in a blue green leather jumper and some snappy black leather leggings. The tie dyed cotton sandals that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” sighed Ms. O’James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was sporting a beautiful dark purple rayon jersey with deep indigo lacy frills and a fantastic blue and purple cotton skirt with deep violet moon beam patterns. On her feet she wore some beautiful white cotton dress shoes with violet moon beam patterns. “I’m too modest, I like being a Commander too!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” said Captain Dwight enigmatically.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” breathed Tammy Smith courageously. She was wearing a violet dacron dress. Some floral print silk sneakers were on her feet.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Tammy Smith,” drawled Dwight Edgmont calmly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-revenge-of-the-saturnian-orb-of-hope">18. The Revenge of The Saturnian Orb of Hope</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was a communications panel. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of eggs,” said Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James firmly. She was sporting a marvellous pale violet silk long coat with frilly dark indigo lace. Her perfect forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some fantastic multi hued rayon trainers with crimson and violet lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” sighed Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the Captain’s chair. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” she whispered with an enigmatic twitch of her nose. She was looking tastless in some ill fitting floral print polyester coveralls with a tacky brown zig zag pattern. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. The outdated orange leather pixie boots that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was cracking open pecans with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight Edgmont. He was looking exciting in a snappy gold coloured dacron hoodie with red polyester trim and some snappy mauve silk leggings with red stripes. His feet were shod in some blue green denim shoes.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Captain Dwight,” Commander Serenity stated blissfully.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned her to step back from the others for a moment. He was wearing a fine plaid silk long coat. On his feet he wore some handsome green polyester dress shoes. His short blonde hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. “There’s a thing I need to talk to you about”, he began enigmatically.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>“Um, about that time in the engine room…” said Commander Joe carefully.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James went beet red with blushing. “Words are not necessary, Commander Joe” she gulped painingly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! Her overbearing mouth in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit.</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Dwight Edgmont yelled.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. She was looking menacing in a deep red dacron sweater and some midnight black silk trousers. Some red silk trainers with dark red stripes were on her feet. “What have we here!” she smiled with a voice like a baboon at a baseball game. She snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith made motions of disbelief with her hands.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gritted his teeth and determined to stay chipper. “Nooooooooooooo!” he squealed with a voice like a tiger in a video arcade.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity barked “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she muttered acidly.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. She lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope into the light. Just then, she was distracted. She lost her grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his smooth yet forceful hand in the direction of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! His ugly brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The blood red rayon great coat with dark red polyester trim he was looking impressive in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod in some handsome deep black polyester shoes.</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Captain Dwight squealed. He put his hand up to his deep chin.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. “I have you now!” he sighed with a voice like an elephant in a snowstorm. He grabbed Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont’s mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” shouted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James with a voice like a gorilla in a snowstorm.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” droned Ms. O’James heavily. She was wearing a fantastic gold coloured polyester smock with rainbow coloured crinkly foil trim. The beautiful purple and gold denim boots with frilly dark indigo lace that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith opened up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” groaned Navigator Tammy exasperatedly.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a DISASTER AREA!!” bleated Serenity Starlight unhappily.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Captain Dwight breathed fawningly. He was wearing a fine pinstripe cotton top and some tie dyed cotton leggings with black stripes. His feet were shod with some snappy green rayon sneakers.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Captain Dwight,” she breathed calmly. She was wearing a plaid rayon top and some floral print leather slacks. The purple nylon sandals that were on her feet looked almost new. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she said peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. There was an air conditioning unit off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity looked around. She was decked out in a silver and purple dacron jumper with silver and purple crinkly foil trim and some dark violet cotton trousers with frilly shimmering multi hued lace. Some fantastic multi hued polyester trainers with frilly purple lace were on her feet. She suddenly had a odd hunch. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelled Navigator Tammy. She was gotten up in an orange red rayon great coat. On her feet she wore some white cotton pixie boots.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Some manacles seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James spotted some Space Badgers in the distance.</p>
<p>“Space Badgers!” mouthed Dwight Edgmont. The fine pink silk jacket he was resplendent in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. Some mauve silk sandals graced his feet.</p>
<p>“Fdqe dakog qgvxrhpz!!!” shouted the Space Badgers in their weird Space Badger language.</p>
<p>A intense skirmish started!</p>
<p>“BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!” bellowed Ms. O’James. The WICKED AWESOME purple and gold denim jersey with frilly shiny silver lace she was looking delightful in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. The fantastic purple and gold cotton sandals adorned with jewels that she had on looked almost new. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her backpack. She raised the Venusian Katana of Power over her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a tremendous power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Badgers with a awesome impact.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room.</p>
<p>“BY THE METEORS OF VENUS!!!” yelled Captain Dwight. He drew the vibro sword out of his backpack. He lifted the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a awesome movement.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Badgers with a mighty whack.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Badgers were strewn across the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” raged Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James sternly. “It looked like those Space Badgers had The Skull Witch’s insignia on their armor,” she chirped peacefully. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” groaned Tammy Smith exasperatedly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a bleak purple denim jerkin and a tasteless floral print dacron skirt with gaudy silver coloured polka dots. On her feet she wore some red denim boots.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Serenity Starlight breathed peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking delightful in a blue crinkly foil long coat with navy blue crinkly foil trim. His feet were shod in some handsome black polyester trainers with black stripes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he said obsequiously. “I would have been toast without you, Captain Dwight,” he giggled laughingly. “I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight,” he whispered courageously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. There was a Captain’s chair off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“That was some top notch thinking I saw from you today, Ms. O’James!” breathed Captain Dwight happily. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Captain, Serenity Starlight!” he giggled lightly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” whispered Serenity Starlight courageously. She was looking fine in a shimmering purple nylon great coat with silver and purple lacy frills. The exquisite pale violet dacron sneakers with rainbow hued star patterns on her feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “I could really go for a pizza right now,” she giggled courageously.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Commander Joe. He was looking smashing in a tan rayon jerkin and some tie dyed polyester culottes with white dacron trim. The snappy navy blue silk dress shoes with red stripes he was looking delightful in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” breathed Captain Dwight firmly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith slumped down on the bean bag chair. She was looking frumpy in a brown nylon sweater and a maroon dacron skirt with a tacky violet zig zag pattern. On her feet she wore some gaudy orange dacron dress shoes.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Serenity Starlight,” giggled Commander Joe enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-secret-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">19. The Secret of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. A communications panel gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the communications panel. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. She was wearing an elegant purple and violet nylon long coat with pale indigo star patterns. Some marvellous purple and violet polyester sneakers with indigo moon beam patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ms. O’James,” smiled Commander Joe Mulbury courageously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the Captain’s chair. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his close cropped black hair. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he whispered firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the air conditioning unit. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” she breathed with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth. She was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the Captain’s chair.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Dwight Edgmont,” Navigator Tammy said lightly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was studiously buffing the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Tammy Smith. She was looking frumpy in a pinstripe dacron jersey with gaudy plaid polka dots and some pinstripe leather slacks. Her feet were shod with some brown crinkly foil boots with a tacky floral print zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Tammy Smith,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James sighed firmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was wearing a black silk track suit. The deep black rayon sandals that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont wasn’t going to let a little thing like this dampen his cheer, though. He was wearing a fine mauve silk suit jacket and some snappy blue green cotton trousers. His feet were shod in some handsome floral print rayon sneakers. “YOU!” he squealed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. “We meet again, do-gooders!” he giggled with a voice like an elephant in a video arcade. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. His ugly brow seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made motions of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight clapped his hands to his cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She lifted the electro wrench to eye level. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” she muttered impatiently.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“The Skull Witch!” Navigator Tammy screeched.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. “So sorry to spoil your party, do-gooders!” she giggled with a voice like a tiger at a monster truck rally. She put her hand up to her overbearing mouth. She was looking menacing in a fine blood coloured dacron leotard. Some fine blood red polyester sneakers were on her feet. She snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” bellowed Tammy Smith with a voice like a rabid dog in a performance art piece.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity made motions of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she bellowed exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in her hand. Without warning, she stumbled. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glanced drably at her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby Captain’s chair. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Nearby was a puddle of icky looking liquid. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” intoned Navigator Tammy enigmatically. The tan leather hoodie she was looking completely unimpressive in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. The mauve silk sneakers that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>With a soft yet forceful motion, Ms. O’James launched the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro measurements look normal,” chirped Serenity Starlight peacefully. She was looking fine in a beautiful purple and white crinkly foil robe with purple and gold star patterns. On her feet she wore some marvellous gold coloured cotton sandals with pale indigo lacy frills.</p>
<p>“… For a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” droned Navigator Tammy drily. Walking along, she suddenly bonked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“What was that?” smiled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James calmly. Walking along, she suddenly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we can get through this we’ll have to find another way in!” groaned Tammy Smith weakly. “We have a duty to rescue Commander Joe Mulbury!” she gasped drably.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The blasted surface of Forbak was pretty much what you’d expect. There were some sickly shrubs off in the corner. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the creeps,” gulped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James heavily. She was sporting a rainbow coloured dacron top with shimmering rainbow coloured moon beam patterns and a marvellous silvery nylon skirt adorned with sapphires. Her feet were shod in some beautiful dark violet dacron dress shoes with deep indigo cotton trim.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” shouted Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. “What have we here!” she smiled with a voice like a giraffe in a rainstorm. She snatched Tammy Smith from behind. She was gotten up in a blood coloured crinkly foil halter top with black stripes and a midnight black polyester skirt. On her feet she wore some blood red rayon sandals. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight shouted “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Nearby was a puddle of icky looking liquid. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James bellowed drily. The fantastic deep violet denim halter top with frilly black and purple lace she was looking impressive in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. Some red and purple silk boots with shimmering multi hued cotton trim graced her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“I would have been a goner without you, Commander Serenity,” she said placidly. She was gotten up in a chartreuse denim gown with a tacky blue green zig zag pattern. The tasteless orange red cotton trainers that were on her feet looked almost new. “Let’s keep moving,” she stated enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage! He was looking ready for action in a handsome maroon dacron hoodie and some mauve crinkly foil slacks. The handsome maroon crinkly foil dress shoes with maroon stripes on his feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he breathed virtuously. “I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight,” he drawled happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy looked around. She lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity. Suddenly, she tripped. She lost her grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“Oops,” said Tammy Smith quietly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight pointed towards Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“What was that noise?” smiled Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy just stared, seemingly paralyzed. She was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont clapped his hands on the sides of his face in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James shouted “OH NO!”.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Serenity Starlight screamed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. “What have we here!” he said with a voice like charcoal driving a race car. He grabbed Dwight Edgmont from behind. He was wearing a deep black nylon top and some snappy blood coloured crinkly foil slacks. His feet were shod in some fine dark black rayon shoes. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight put her hands to her cheeks in shock. “We must find out where Captain Dwight is being held!” she raged impatiently. “I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,” she barked enigmatically. “Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” she screeched acidly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Wallabies came around the corner.</p>
<p>“Uh oh, looks like we’ve got company,” yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James emphatically.</p>
<p>“Wnc fvtjzxwf uyjvvpmq imbprnv!!!” shouted the Space Wallabies in their weird Space Wallabie language.</p>
<p>A harrowing skirmish started!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Wallabies littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” barked Commander Serenity menacingly. “It looked like those Space Wallabies had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their jerseys,” she breathed enigmatically. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”. “Let’s keep moving,” she chirped virtuously.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Ms. O’James,” he whispered courageously. He wasted no time. He helped dig Tammy Smith out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“Hurry!” Serenity Starlight said. She helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Captain Dwight,” sighed Tammy Smith calmly. “I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James spotted some Space Slugs in the distance.</p>
<p>“Uh oh, looks like they’ve found us,” sighed Tammy Smith enigmatically.</p>
<p>“Gzoj nfy ufjtxegz!!!” shouted the Space Slugs in their strange Space Slug language.</p>
<p>A fierce battle took place!</p>
<p>“BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!” screeched Commander Serenity. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her equipment bag. She heaved the Venusian Katana of Power over her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a tremendous movement.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Slugs with a awesome whack.</p>
<p>The Space Slugs went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, stunned Space Slugs were strewn across the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” splurted Commander Serenity drily.</p>
<p>“It looked like those Space Slugs had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their clothes,” whispered Tammy Smith virtuously. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” bleated Commander Serenity unhappily. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby puddle of icky looking liquid. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” squealed Navigator Tammy. “Let’s keep moving,” she drawled calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,” he smiled energetically. “Thank you, Captain Dwight,” he breathed placidly. He was sporting a fine black dacron shirt and some red dacron culottes. His short blonde hair seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. Some handsome chartreuse leather sandals graced his feet. “I would have been toast without you, Ms. O’James,” he chirped firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some top notch thinking today, Ms. O’James!” whispered Dwight Edgmont peacefully. He was wearing a plaid rayon muscle shirt with black silk trim and some chartreuse nylon culottes. On his feet he wore some yellow dacron shoes with silver coloured silk trim. “I think I should promote you to Captain, Ms. O’James!” he giggled firmly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” blushed Serenity Starlight virtuously. She was decked out in a beautiful purple and white silk robe with frilly rainbow hued lace. The fantastic purple and white polyester pumps with shiny purple star patterns that she had on looked almost new. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” sighed Commander Joe blissfully.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a pizza after that,” chirped Dwight Edgmont firmly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Serenity Starlight,” smiled Joe Mulbury firmly. He was looking fine in an orange leather hoodie and some blue cotton trousers with green stripes. On his feet he wore some navy blue polyester boots with brown stripes.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-secret-of-the-skull-witch">20. The Secret of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. She was decked out in an elegant silver coloured leather jumper with frilly crimson and violet lace and some marvellous multi hued polyester slacks with silvery moon beam patterns. The fantastic silvery polyester trainers with white lacy frills that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the communications panel. He was looking smashing in a fine orange dacron suit jacket and some handsome yellow rayon leggings. Some pink rayon sandals with purple leather trim graced his feet. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the Captain’s chair. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he whispered obsequiously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the navigation dashboard. The fine silver coloured rayon jerkin he was looking ready for action in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod with some maroon cotton sneakers. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” he breathed with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was looking tastless in a gaudy mauve nylon track suit. The bleak tan denim boots with gaudy brown polka dots that were on her feet looked almost new. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” she whispered with an enigmatic twitch of her ears.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was meticulously cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Tammy Smith,” Commander Joe smiled firmly. He surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope into the light. All of a sudden, he tripped. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of his grip.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at him. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her short blonde hair.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glared in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James glanced enigmatically at Joe Mulbury. With a soft yet confident motion, she gestured to Joe Mulbury to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk about”, she began slumblingly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Serenity?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Well, about last night in the engine room…” whispered Serenity Starlight painingly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe blushed a deep red. “It’s all right, Ms. O’James, you don’t need to say anything,” he muttered slowly.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” bellowed Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled disdainfully. She was looking intimidating in a red polyester hoodie and some black rayon culottes. On her feet she wore some fine blood red denim boots. “We meet again, chums!” she giggled with a voice like a crazed bull in a bazaar. She grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” yelled Dwight Edgmont fawningly.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth opened wide in shock.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she yelled firmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a security drone whizzed past Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What was that?” she bellowed drily. She blinked drily.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. In the centre of the area was a puddle of icky looking liquid. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the chills,” gulped Navigator Tammy irksomely.</p>
<p>“Enviro readings look normal,” yelled Serenity Starlight, peering down at her hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. She was sporting an elegant crimson denim frock with white lacy frills and some fantastic silver and purple silk culottes adorned with emeralds. Her feet were shod in some elegant dark violet nylon sandals with midnight black star patterns.</p>
<p>“Sure, normal… for a DISASTER AREA!!” droned Navigator Tammy grumpily. She was looking frumpy in a plaid cotton robe. Some tie dyed polyester trainers with gaudy blue green polka dots were on her feet.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“What was that noise?” she groaned.</p>
<p>Too quickly for anyone to react, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont stood frozen like a deer in headlights. He was wearing a white polyester top and some white polyester culottes. His feet were shod with some snappy silver coloured polyester trainers with tie dyed stripes. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made motions of shock with her arms.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight yelped “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was wearing a black polyester jumpsuit. Her long green hair seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. Some dark red leather sandals were on her feet.</p>
<p>“YOU!” yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled hatefully. “So sorry to spoil your little party, do-gooders!” she breathed with a voice like a tiger in a performance art piece. She grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight clapped her hands to the sides of her face in disbelief. “Let’s keep moving,” she bellowed annoyingly.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she giggled happily. “We must hurry!” she breathed. She helped dig Dwight Edgmont out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“Hurry!” Ms. O’James stated. She helped dig Dwight Edgmont out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Tammy Smith,” stated Dwight Edgmont fawningly. “I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he giggled obsequiously. His deep chin in profile threw a shadow on the door to the dungeon.</p>
<p>With a gentle yet forceful motion, Tammy Smith picked up the shards of broken glass that were nearby. She lifted the shards of broken glass to eye level. “These shards of broken glass represents how I feel inside,” she giggled blissfully.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Serenity Starlight chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was looking fine in a fine violet cotton shirt and some handsome gold coloured dacron culottes. The purple dacron trainers with orange red stripes he was looking smashing in seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he chirped happily. “I would have been a goner without you, Captain Dwight,” he smiled lightly. “I am indebted to you, Commander Serenity,” he sighed obsequiously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. A navigation dashboard gleamed in the fluorescent light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James looked around. She was wearing a marvellous shiny silver dacron shirt with purple and violet cotton trim and some exquisite crimson and violet crinkly foil trousers with silver and purple star patterns. The WICKED AWESOME blue and purple polyester sneakers with indigo silk trim that were on her feet looked almost new. She suddenly had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Navigator Tammy. She was looking frumpy in a plaid cotton long coat. On her feet she wore some ill fitting black polyester dress shoes.</p>
<p>“There was some top notch action from you today, Commander Serenity!” chirped Dwight Edgmont obsequiously. He was wearing a fine black rayon hoodie with silver coloured crinkly foil trim and some fine orange cotton leggings with floral print rayon trim. Some fine silver coloured polyester boots were on his feet. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Captain, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he sighed energetically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” smiled Ms. O’James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. “I’m too modest, I like being a Commander too!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she stated strongly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a curry after that,” said Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” giggled Navigator Tammy lightly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Joe Mulbury,” chirped Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-of-the-skull-witch">21. The Time of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. A communications panel seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the air conditioning unit. The fantastic black and purple crinkly foil jersey with frilly gold coloured lace she was decked out in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some purple and violet denim shoes with shiny purple moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. He was decked out in a blue leather sweater and some tie dyed denim slacks with green nylon trim. His feet were shod in some snappy navy blue dacron sneakers. His handsome brow in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he said obsequiously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the navigation dashboard. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” he chirped lightly. He was looking exciting in a black leather muscle shirt and some fine blue green silk trousers. The silver coloured cotton sneakers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are plum out of eggs,” giggled Navigator Tammy Smith fawningly. She was looking frumpy in a bleak chartreuse polyester hoodie with gaudy blue green polka dots and some maroon silk culottes. The blue cotton pumps that were on her feet looked almost new. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” she giggled with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet strong motion, Captain Dwight picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He held the cup of coffee in his hand. His deep chin seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he breathed happily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned Serenity Starlight to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I need to talk to you about”, he began slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Commander Serenity. She put her hand up to her perfect forehead.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“Well, … there comes a time when…” groaned Joe Mulbury carefully.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She put her hand up to her overbearing mouth. The handsome blood coloured rayon sweater she was looking intimidating in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some deep red cotton pumps.</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Tammy Smith barked.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled hatefully. “I have you now!” she whispered with a voice like a baboon in a pet shop. She snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith’s mouth gawped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” shouted Commander Joe with a voice like a tiger in a gymnasium parking lot.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth opened wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She lifted the cup of coffee into the light. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she raged threateningly.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity motioned Joe Mulbury to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I need to say to you”, she began slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ms. O’James?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Um, about last night in the mess hall…” whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James slumblingly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury went beet red with blushing. “Speak not of it, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James” he breathed painingly.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There was a torch in a thing on the wall off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” bleated Navigator Tammy weakly. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the manacles. She was looking completely unimpressive in a chartreuse polyester jumper and some plaid polyester leggings. Her feet were shod with some plaid cotton trainers.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet forceful motion, Commander Serenity started the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” groaned Serenity Starlight irritatedly. She was looking smashing in a marvellous shimmering multi hued nylon suit jacket with dark purple moon beam patterns and some marvellous silver coloured cotton leggings with rainbow coloured lacy frills. Some elegant crimson and violet denim trainers adorned with emeralds graced her feet.</p>
<p>“Normal, sure… for a PIT!!” mumbled Tammy Smith weakly.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” screamed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wildly. He was looking intimidating in a handsome black silk jumper and some dark black denim leggings. On his feet he wore some deep red nylon shoes. “I have you now!” he giggled with a voice like a hurricane in a snowstorm. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith put her hands on her cheeks in disbelief.</p>
<p>“NOOO!” shouted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James irritatedly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Navigator Tammy intoned sternly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in a blue green cotton jacket and some orange red dacron trousers. Some silver coloured rayon shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,” he breathed strongly. “I would have been toast without you, Serenity Starlight,” he stated placidly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James drawled fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was sporting a handsome white rayon top and some snappy pink leather culottes with navy blue nylon trim. His feet were shod in some fine orange red leather sneakers with blue green stripes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he stated strongly. “I would have been a goner without you, Commander Joe,” he drawled strongly. “I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he chirped strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“There was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight!” breathed Dwight Edgmont strongly. The green denim jacket he was wearing seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The snappy gold coloured silk sneakers that were on his feet looked almost new. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Captain, Commander Serenity!” he drawled enigmatically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” breathed Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. The exquisite silvery rayon gown with red and purple moon beam patterns she was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some dark purple dacron trainers with multi hued lacy frills. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. She flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” stated Joe Mulbury enigmatically.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a soda after that,” giggled Navigator Tammy firmly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="21"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-space-ferrets">22. The Space Ferrets</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was a view screen. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the communications panel. She was wearing a silvery leather sweater adorned with jewels and some silvery nylon culottes adorned with sapphires. Her perfect forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The beautiful midnight black polyester pumps with shimmering rainbow hued star patterns that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight,” breathed Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his ears. He was wearing a handsome mauve rayon smock with blue green stripes. Some handsome orange denim shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. His close cropped black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He was wearing a handsome orange red dacron shirt with orange stripes and some purple polyester trousers with black denim trim. The floral print cotton sneakers on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he stated placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the communications panel.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“It’s not the type of thing you can just order off Omnizon, Tammy Smith,” Joe Mulbury stated virtuously. He motioned Ms. O’James to step away from the others for a moment. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights. “There’s something I need to talk about”, he began slumblingly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>“Uh, about last night in the engine room…” whispered Commander Joe slumblingly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James blushed a deep red. “Hush, Commander Joe, there’s no need, you know that,” she gulped slumblingly.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking impressive in a black nylon jacket and some fine deep black rayon culottes. His feet were shod in some blood coloured nylon sneakers.</p>
<p>“It’s Nebulon!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his shoulder length green hair. “We meet again, kiddies!” he whispered with a voice like a samurai in a pet shop. He grabbed Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith made motions of surprise with her arms. She was wearing an ill fitting tie dyed crinkly foil frock and some silver coloured silk leggings. Her feet were shod with some tacky orange nylon sneakers.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury bellowed “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth opened wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she groaned firmly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James gestured to Commander Joe to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk to you about”, she began slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Serenity Starlight?” asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked away.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Serenity?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Serenity and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“Uh, … there comes a time when…” muttered Ms. O’James enigmatically.</p>
<p>Commander Joe surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity to eye level. All of a sudden, he tripped. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“Whoopsy-daisy,” breathed Joe Mulbury quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at him.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity moved her soft yet forceful arm in the direction of Joe Mulbury. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a unusual intuition. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” yelped Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A puddle of icky looking liquid seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the creeps,” said Serenity Starlight slowly. She was sporting a fantastic dark indigo denim jerkin with frilly shiny purple lace and an exquisite white dacron skirt with dark violet moon beam patterns. Some fantastic multi hued silk sandals with crimson star patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>“Enviro readings look normal,” drawled Tammy Smith, peering down at her hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. She was gotten up in a gaudy red polyester jersey and some outdated pink rayon leggings. On her feet she wore some ill fitting brown polyester boots with a tacky red zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>“… For a DUMP!!” gasped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James grumpily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking impressive in a handsome midnight black nylon hoodie and some handsome deep red denim leggings. The red rayon pixie boots she was looking impressive in seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>“The Skull Witch!” Tammy Smith barked.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled hatefully. “What have we here!” she stated with a voice like a hurricane in a pet shop. She grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with her.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” shouted Tammy Smith viciously.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight put her hands on the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. She held the bottle caps in her hand. “These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,” she splurted menacingly. Her narrow forehead in profile threw a shadow on the torch in a thing on the wall.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Ferrets came around the corner.</p>
<p>“Space Ferrets!” hissed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Zul xwdbbp awsgrgj kmonvd!!!” shouted the Space Ferrets in their strange Space Ferret language.</p>
<p>A harrowing skirmish had begun!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, stunned Space Ferrets littered the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” bellowed Tammy Smith emphatically. “It looked like those Space Ferrets had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their uniforms,” she whispered courageously. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” mumbled Ms. O’James heavily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. She lifted the bottle caps. “These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,” she breathed energetically.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“Did you hear something?” Commander Serenity mumbled.</p>
<p>Without warning, with a overwhelming boom, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy just stared, seemingly paralyzed. She was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity screeched “NOOO!”. She wasted no time. She helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Commander Serenity,” breathed Tammy Smith peacefully.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ms. O’James breathed energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was sporting a fine chartreuse silk top with chartreuse stripes and some navy blue nylon slacks. The orange red cotton dress shoes on his feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he sighed virtuously. “I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he chirped energetically.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Tammy Smith chirped laughingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,” he whispered laughingly. “Thank you, Commander Joe,” he drawled blissfully. “I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he chirped placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some ace thinking today, Serenity Starlight!” chirped Dwight Edgmont obsequiously. “I think I should promote you to Captain, Serenity Starlight!” he giggled strongly. He was looking exciting in a handsome silver coloured nylon jersey and some fine silver coloured leather slacks. The tie dyed nylon dress shoes with gold coloured crinkly foil trim that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James fawningly. She was sporting an elegant white cotton great coat with purple and violet lacy frills. The beautiful purple and gold nylon shoes adorned with rubies on her feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. She flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” chirped Commander Joe lightly. He was looking impressive in a fine navy blue denim robe. Some violet dacron trainers graced his feet.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” breathed Captain Dwight obsequiously.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” smiled Navigator Tammy obsequiously. “Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Joe Mulbury,” she said virtuously. She was looking tastless in a white polyester robe. The ill fitting tie dyed dacron dress shoes that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="22"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-venusian-staff-of-power">23. The Venusian Staff of Power</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. Not too far away was an air conditioning unit. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the view screen. The violet polyester leotard with rainbow coloured star patterns she was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some marvellous purple rayon pixie boots with frilly rainbow hued lace.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the view screen. He was wearing a maroon leather shirt and some silver coloured silk leggings. His feet were shod in some fine silver coloured leather dress shoes with yellow stripes. “Hello, Captain Serenity,” he drawled calmly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>“Hello, Commander Joe,” breathed Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was meticulously polishing the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight. His deep chin seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Captain Dwight,” Serenity Starlight drawled virtuously. She put her hand up to her perfect forehead. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She held the Venusian Staff of Power in her hand. Just then, she tripped. The Venusian Staff of Power slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“Drat,” groaned Serenity Starlight quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith moved her soft yet masterful arm in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe pointed towards Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glanced happily at Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James. Suddenly, a cleaning drone flew close by his head. “What was that?” he smiled happily. He whistled strongly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk to you about”, he said carefully.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“Um, …” groaned Joe Mulbury awkwardly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>“Well, … there comes a time when…” muttered Commander Joe carefully.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. “So sorry to spoil your little party, kiddies!” he smiled with a voice like a gorilla piloting a helicopter. He grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his shoulder length green locks. He was wearing a dark red rayon track suit. The handsome deep black silk trainers that he had on looked almost new. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made motions of disbelief with her hands.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” shouted Captain Dwight with a voice like a ninja at a monster truck rally. He was wearing some fine yellow silk coveralls. On his feet he wore some brown polyester trainers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight barked “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the star charts that were nearby. She was looking completely unimpressive in a maroon nylon tank top and some violet silk trousers. Some blue crinkly foil boots were on her feet. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the view screen. She held the star charts in her hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she intoned viciously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A torch in a thing on the wall seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” mumbled Captain Serenity heavily. She was looking delightful in a fantastic midnight black polyester jacket with rainbow coloured lightning bolt patterns and some elegant pale purple cotton trousers with indigo star patterns. Her feet were shod in some beautiful shimmering rainbow hued polyester sandals with crimson lacy frills.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith opened up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” bleated Tammy Smith slowly.</p>
<p>“Sure, normal… for a DUMP!!” mumbled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James downheartedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon appeared! He was looking impressive in a fine dark black cotton jumpsuit. The handsome black cotton boots that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. “I have you now!” he drawled with a voice like charcoal in a jewellery store. He snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith’s mouth gawped wide in shock. She was gotten up in a white rayon leotard with gaudy chartreuse polka dots. Some ill fitting tie dyed nylon sandals were on her feet.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James made gestures of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Tammy Smith muttered firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was resplendent in some navy blue leather coveralls. His feet were shod with some snappy red crinkly foil sneakers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Navigator Tammy,” he chirped happily. “I am in debt to you, Ms. O’James,” he chirped happily. “Let’s keep moving,” he whispered strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! The handsome orange silk jerkin with green stripes he was sporting seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. On his feet he wore some green dacron trainers with pink polyester trim.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he giggled peacefully. “I would have been toast without you, Dwight Edgmont,” he sighed fawningly. “I would have been a goner without you, Ms. O’James,” he drawled energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. A Captain’s chair gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James looked around. She was decked out in an exquisite silver and purple denim tank top with frilly rainbow hued lace and some elegant pale violet silk culottes adorned with gems. On her feet she wore some elegant rainbow coloured silk sandals with blue and purple moon beam patterns. She suddenly had a hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” shouted Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“There was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Captain Serenity!” drawled Captain Dwight firmly. He was sporting a handsome brown leather suit jacket and some yellow cotton leggings with chartreuse dacron trim. His feet were shod with some fine silver coloured silk dress shoes. “I think I should promote you to Commodore, Captain Serenity!” he said strongly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Captain Serenity fawningly. “I’m too modest, I like being a Captain too!”. She flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a curry after that,” giggled Joe Mulbury laughingly.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” chirped Captain Dwight happily.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Navigator Tammy. She was looking tastless in an orange dacron jerkin and a floral print polyester skirt with a tacky pinstripe zig zag pattern. The bleak green rayon dress shoes with a tacky mauve zig zag pattern that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Captain Serenity,” whispered Joe Mulbury lightly. His short blonde hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="23"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-venusian-staff-of-power">24. The Return of The Venusian Staff of Power</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a view screen off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. She was looking smashing in an elegant shimmering purple nylon dress with pale violet denim trim. Some marvellous crimson and violet dacron shoes with frilly purple and white lace were on her feet. She put her hand up to her perfect forehead.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the Captain’s chair.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of eggs,” sighed Navigator Tammy Smith virtuously.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James was cracking open pecans with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight Edgmont. He was wearing a maroon denim shirt with tie dyed leather trim and some brown dacron culottes. His feet were shod with some fine orange crinkly foil sandals.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Captain Dwight,” Serenity Starlight drawled placidly. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She lifted the Venusian Staff of Power into the light. Suddenly, she stubbed her toe. She lost her grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith pointed towards her. Her narrow forehead seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe moved his soft yet firm arm in the direction of Serenity Starlight. He was looking delightful in a pinstripe leather trench coat. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel. Some orange red crinkly foil sneakers graced his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glared in the direction of Ms. O’James. With a supple yet forceful motion, he picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts into the light. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his close cropped black hair. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” he stated blissfully.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking impressive in a fine dark red rayon hoodie and some red silk slacks. The handsome deep red polyester trainers with deep red stripes that he had on looked almost new. His shoulder length green hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” shouted Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. “We meet again, chums!” he smiled with a voice like a baboon at a square dance. He grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith clapped her hands on the sides of her face in shock.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight made gestures of surprise with his arms.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth opened wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. She was looking frumpy in a pink dacron jumper and a gaudy white dacron skirt. The plaid silk shoes she was wearing seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she barked viciously.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a cleaning drone whizzed past Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What the devil was that?” she bellowed viciously. She frowned outrageously.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. Not too far away was a puddle of icky looking liquid. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” groaned Serenity Starlight heavily. She was sporting a beautiful dark indigo denim hoodie with rainbow coloured lightning bolt patterns and some fantastic pale purple dacron trousers with dark indigo lacy frills. The elegant pale indigo dacron shoes with crimson and violet lightning bolt patterns on her feet seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>“Enviro metrics look normal,” drawled Dwight Edgmont, peering down at his hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. He was sporting a pinstripe denim jersey with black dacron trim and some fine chartreuse denim trousers. On his feet he wore some purple denim boots.</p>
<p>“Normal, sure… for a PIT!!” droned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James drably.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! Her overbearing mouth in profile cast a shadow against the torch in a thing on the wall. She was gotten up in a handsome blood coloured silk shirt with red crinkly foil trim and some blood coloured crinkly foil culottes. The fine red rayon sneakers with deep black stripes that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” squealed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled hatefully. “What have we here!” she giggled with a voice like a giraffe in a performance art piece. She snatched Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>
<p>This was bad, but Captain Dwight didn’t let it cramp his style. “Nooooooooooooo!” he yelled virtuously.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity bellowed “OH NO!”.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Tammy Smith!” stated Captain Dwight virtuously.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,” raged Captain Serenity sternly.</p>
<p>“Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” yelled Captain Dwight obsequiously. He picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. He lifted the skull of a Space Rat to eye level. “This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,” he chirped enigmatically. “Let’s keep moving,” he smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was looking completely unimpressive in a violet nylon hoodie and some black rayon culottes. The orange dacron pixie boots she was gotten up in seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,” she said strongly. “I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight,” she drawled lightly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Dwight Edgmont sighed virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he smiled happily. “I would have been lost without you, Dwight Edgmont,” he chirped calmly. He was looking smashing in a handsome silver coloured dacron great coat with violet stripes. His feet were shod with some gold coloured dacron sandals. “I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he breathed firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. An air conditioning unit gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked around. She was looking fine in an exquisite crimson dacron jumper with pale violet lightning bolt patterns and a pale indigo nylon skirt with shimmering rainbow coloured star patterns. The elegant multi hued polyester boots adorned with sapphires she was looking impressive in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She suddenly had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” squealed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“You displayed some quick action today, Serenity Starlight!” stated Dwight Edgmont lightly. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commodore, Captain Serenity!” he breathed obsequiously. He was resplendent in some red crinkly foil coveralls. Some chartreuse dacron trainers were on his feet.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” giggled Ms. O’James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she said fawningly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a pizza right now,” drawled Joe Mulbury obsequiously.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” breathed Captain Dwight lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy flumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” stated Dwight Edgmont blissfully.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-space-ferrets">25. The Return of The Space Ferrets</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. There was a view screen off in the corner. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was looking smashing in a beautiful purple and white nylon track suit with deep indigo denim trim. On her feet she wore some elegant pale indigo polyester dress shoes adorned with rubies. Her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the air conditioning unit. He was looking fine in some fine white nylon coveralls. Some yellow dacron trainers were on his feet. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he breathed courageously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. He was looking exciting in a tie dyed crinkly foil track suit. His deep chin seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod with some brown silk dress shoes. “Hello, Commander Joe,” he drawled with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. She was wearing a navy blue crinkly foil halter top with a tacky black zig zag pattern and some orange red cotton slacks. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. The purple nylon trainers that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity was studiously cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Dwight Edgmont,” Serenity Starlight chirped obsequiously.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! Her overbearing mouth in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit. She was looking intimidating in a snappy black crinkly foil top and some snappy deep red nylon leggings. On her feet she wore some midnight black crinkly foil shoes.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gritted his teeth and determined to stay upbeat.</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James screamed.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. “So sorry to spoil your little party, kiddies!” she smiled with a voice like a rabid dog in a snowstorm. She snatched Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury put his hands to the sides of his face in surprise. He put his hand up to his handsome brow.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont made motions of disbelief with his arms.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” barked Captain Serenity with a voice like an elephant in a mosh pit.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Tammy Smith!” raged Commander Joe strongly.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James irritatedly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” barked Joe Mulbury exasperatedly. He picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He held the cup of coffee in his hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he raged irritatedly. Out of the blue, a cooking drone flew close by his head. “What the devil was that?” he raged icily. He blinked viciously.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James surveyed the area with her eyes. She held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in her hand. Suddenly, she stubbed her toe. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“Whoops,” gulped Captain Serenity quietly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his gentle yet forceful hand in the direction of Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She suddenly had a odd inkling. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A torch in a thing on the wall seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James enigmatically. She was wearing an elegant crimson rayon robe with rainbow hued denim trim. Her feet were shod with some elegant violet polyester sandals with silver and purple moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>With a soft yet strong motion, Commander Joe dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro metrics look normal,” drawled Commander Joe happily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a DUMP!!” groaned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James unhappily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” bellowed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wildly. He was looking impressive in a red leather shirt and some red dacron trousers. The blood coloured polyester boots with black stripes that he had on looked almost new. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on his shoulder length green locks. “I have you now!” he breathed with a voice like a hurricane at a monster truck rally. He grabbed Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth gaped wide in shock. He was looking fine in a snappy blue green nylon muscle shirt with chartreuse stripes and some fine red dacron leggings with blue green stripes. The fine orange red nylon dress shoes on his feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity clapped her hands on the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>With a supple yet confident motion, Joe Mulbury picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. He lifted the bottle caps to eye level. “These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,” he barked emphatically.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“Did you hear something?” Ms. O’James yelled.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury stood frozen like a deer in headlights. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James screeched “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James spotted some Space Ferrets in the distance.</p>
<p>“Uh oh, looks like they’ve found us,” said Ms. O’James enigmatically.</p>
<p>“Wizk moji upnjehcl ylrm ovdr!!!” shouted the Space Ferrets in their weird Space Ferret language.</p>
<p>A intense battle began!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Ferrets were strewn across the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” muttered Captain Serenity sternly. “It looked like those Space Ferrets had The Skull Witch’s insignia on their armor,” she sighed obsequiously. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”. “There’s no time to lose!” she cried. She helped dig Joe Mulbury out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Captain Serenity,” sighed Commander Joe courageously. He motioned Ms. O’James to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I wanted to talk about”, he gasped slowly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>“Uh, about that time in the loading bay…” said Commander Joe painfully.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went beet red with blushing. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury’s lips. She motioned Commander Joe to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s something I wanted to say to you”, she began painingly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Captain Serenity?” asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity scratched her knee.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ms. O’James?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“Uh, … there comes a time when…” muttered Ms. O’James coyly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Slugs came around the corner.</p>
<p>“Space Slugs!” mouthed Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“Bae nueggm jcnxyd talqyvk!!!” shouted the Space Slugs in their weird Space Slug language.</p>
<p>A fierce skirmish started!</p>
<p>Ms. O’James ran to the side, to try to attack them from the rear. She wasn’t watching where she was going and bumped into Commander Joe in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked at her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight went beet red with blushing.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Commander Joe rushed back into the fray.</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, stunned Space Slugs littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” whispered Captain Serenity painingly.</p>
<p>“It looked like those Space Slugs had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their uniforms,” chirped Commander Joe obsequiously. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” droned Ms. O’James sadly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Joe Mulbury chirped blissfully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was resplendent in a fine white dacron shirt and some silver coloured nylon leggings with red silk trim. On his feet he wore some tie dyed silk trainers.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Joe Mulbury,” he chirped fawningly. “I am indebted to you, Ms. O’James,” he stated strongly. “Let’s keep moving,” he whispered virtuously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! The blue silk gown she was looking completely unimpressive in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. The red rayon pixie boots on her feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Joe Mulbury,” she said obsequiously. “Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,” she stated laughingly. “I am indebted to you, Captain Serenity,” she drawled firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some quick thinking today, Ms. O’James!” smiled Captain Dwight firmly. “I think I should promote you to Commodore, Serenity Starlight!” he smiled obsequiously. He was sporting a gold coloured rayon top and some chartreuse cotton slacks with gold coloured stripes. Some violet nylon dress shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” blushed Captain Serenity happily. She was sporting a fantastic purple cotton tank top with frilly shiny purple lace and some exquisite dark indigo polyester culottes adorned with rubies. The exquisite dark indigo crinkly foil trainers with frilly pale violet lace that were on her feet looked almost new. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury flumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” giggled Captain Dwight placidly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” drawled Tammy Smith virtuously.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” drawled Dwight Edgmont laughingly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="25"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-revenge-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">26. The Revenge of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. Nearby was a Captain’s chair. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the communications panel. Her perfect forehead seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. She was looking smashing in a beautiful deep indigo leather halter top with pale purple moon beam patterns and some gold coloured denim leggings with indigo moon beam patterns. Some dark indigo polyester trainers with rainbow hued nylon trim were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the navigation dashboard. He was wearing a navy blue nylon suit jacket and some tie dyed silk trousers with white stripes. On his feet he wore some silver coloured silk sandals. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he said firmly. He was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy Smith. She was looking completely unimpressive in an outdated gold coloured silk halter top and some green rayon leggings. Her feet were shod in some green leather pixie boots.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Navigator Tammy,” Commander Joe whispered happily.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Navigator Tammy screeched.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wildly. “We meet again, do-gooders!” she said with a voice like a giraffe at a square dance. She snatched Captain Dwight Edgmont from behind. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her long green hair. She was looking intimidating in some dark red denim coveralls. Some dark black rayon pixie boots graced her feet. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith’s mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hands to the sides of his face in shock.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James made motions of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Dwight Edgmont is being held!” intoned Joe Mulbury icily.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Captain Dwight is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” raged Serenity Starlight threateningly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” screamed Commander Joe firmly. He picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He lifted the cup of coffee. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he muttered outrageously.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” screamed Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. “What have we here!” she said with a voice like a baboon piloting a helicopter. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>“NOOO!” shouted Commander Joe threateningly. He put his hand up to his handsome brow.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight bellowed “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Tammy Smith is being held!” muttered Commander Joe impatiently.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Tammy Smith is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,” groaned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James firmly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” bellowed Joe Mulbury exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There was a puddle of icky looking liquid off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” gasped Commander Joe drably.</p>
<p>“Enviro readings look normal,” intoned Serenity Starlight, looking down at her hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. She was looking fine in a marvellous indigo crinkly foil sweater adorned with emeralds and some exquisite silver and purple cotton trousers adorned with jewels. The marvellous black and purple polyester boots with pale violet lightning bolt patterns she was decked out in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a DUMP!!” mumbled Commander Joe sadly. He was wearing a purple denim hoodie and some orange leather culottes. The handsome black silk sandals that he had on looked almost new. He surveyed the area with his eyes. He held the Star Jewel of Eternity in his hand. Suddenly, he lost his balance. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity glanced exasperatedly at him. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a strange inkling. She looked behind the nearby manacles. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Joe Mulbury. “Let’s keep moving,” he whispered peacefully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! The brown polyester track suit she was looking tastless in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. Her narrow forehead in profile threw a shadow on the puddle of icky looking liquid. The gaudy white nylon pumps with a tacky navy blue zig zag pattern on her feet seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Joe Mulbury,” she chirped obsequiously. “I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight,” she chirped courageously. With a exquisite yet powerful motion, she picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. She lifted the skull of a Space Rat to eye level. “This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,” she whispered happily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Wallabies attacked Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>A epic skirmish began!</p>
<p>“BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!” yelled Serenity Starlight. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her equipment bag. She lifted the Venusian Katana of Power above her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a mighty force.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Wallabies with a awesome thud.</p>
<p>The Space Wallabies went flying across the room.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James sprinted to the side, looking to attack them from the rear. She wasn’t looking where she was going and bumped into Joe Mulbury in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked at her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James blushed a deep red.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Joe Mulbury rushed back into the fight.</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, stunned Space Wallabies littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close call!” breathed Serenity Starlight awkwardly.</p>
<p>“It looked like those Space Wallabies had The Skull Witch’s insignia on their clothes,” whispered Tammy Smith enigmatically. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” intoned Commander Joe unhappily. “Let’s keep moving,” he he bleatedavily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“I would have been a goner without you, Navigator Tammy,” he smiled energetically. “Thank you, Joe Mulbury,” he smiled laughingly. His close cropped black hair seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. “I would have been toast without you, Captain Serenity,” he whispered lightly. He was looking exciting in a red crinkly foil smock. His feet were shod with some blue green denim boots.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. A communications panel gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“There was some quick action from you today, Captain Serenity!” chirped Dwight Edgmont firmly. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commodore, Captain Serenity!” he chirped virtuously. He was sporting a violet denim track suit with chartreuse leather trim. On his feet he wore some snappy purple leather trainers.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” drawled Captain Serenity, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was wearing a fantastic purple and violet rayon hoodie with frilly rainbow coloured lace and some beautiful multi hued leather slacks adorned with rubies. The marvellous silver coloured polyester shoes with frilly shiny purple lace that were on her feet looked almost new. “I’m too modest, I like being a Captain too!”. “I could really go for a parmo right now,” she said lightly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” giggled Captain Dwight strongly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Navigator Tammy. She was looking frumpy in a pinstripe denim jumper and some brown leather culottes. Her feet were shod with some tacky mauve silk sandals.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Joe Mulbury,” giggled Serenity Starlight peacefully.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="26"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-scourge-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">27. The Scourge of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. In the centre of the area was a navigation dashboard. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of Space Sugar,” said Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James peacefully. She was wearing a fantastic deep indigo rayon jersey with rainbow coloured polyester trim and some WICKED AWESOME shimmering multi hued dacron slacks with shimmering rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod with some indigo nylon dress shoes with frilly pale indigo lace.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the Captain’s chair. He was sporting a snappy pinstripe silk sweater with plaid dacron trim and some tan cotton culottes with chartreuse stripes. Some pink dacron boots were on his feet. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he giggled with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>“Hello, Commander Joe,” whispered Captain Dwight Edgmont energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the air conditioning unit. “Hello, Captain Dwight,” she drawled with an enigmatic twitch of her ears. She was looking frumpy in a navy blue dacron blouse and some brown leather leggings with gaudy plaid polka dots. On her feet she wore some plaid silk pixie boots.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James was intently cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Dwight Edgmont,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James smiled energetically.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Tammy Smith. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her short blonde locks.</p>
<p>“It’s not the type of thing you can just order off Omnizon, Tammy Smith,” Joe Mulbury drawled calmly. He looked around. He held the Star Jewel of Eternity in his hand. All of a sudden, he stubbed his toe. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” whispered Joe Mulbury quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont glanced virtuously at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>With a gentle yet forceful motion, Joe Mulbury motioned her to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I need to talk to you about”, he began carefully.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“You know, about that time in the engine room…” muttered Commander Joe painingly. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went beet red with blushing. Her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. “Hush, Joe Mulbury, there’s no need, you know that,” she breathed enigmatically.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a delivery drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What in the world was that?” he chirped blissfully. His close cropped black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He whistled energetically. He was wearing a yellow leather muscle shirt and some maroon nylon culottes. The brown crinkly foil sneakers that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James surveyed the area. She lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope. All of a sudden, she tripped. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured towards Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his exquisite yet forceful hand in the direction of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury gestured to Captain Serenity to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s something I wanted to say to you”, he began coyly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“Uh, …” breathed Joe Mulbury slumblingly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James and Joe Mulbury moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>“You know, … there comes a time when…” muttered Commander Joe carefully.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” squealed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James looked around. She all of a sudden had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelled Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“There was some top notch action from you today, Ms. O’James!” whispered Captain Dwight placidly. “I think I should promote you to Commodore, Captain Serenity!” he stated firmly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” whispered Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” breathed Joe Mulbury firmly.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” giggled Captain Dwight enigmatically.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a pizza after that,” sighed Tammy Smith placidly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Joe Mulbury,” giggled Ms. O’James obsequiously.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-menace-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">28. The Menace of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the view screen. She was decked out in an elegant shiny purple crinkly foil hoodie with pale violet lightning bolt patterns and some marvellous dark purple cotton leggings with purple and gold lightning bolt patterns. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. The WICKED AWESOME shiny silver silk shoes with crimson crinkly foil trim she was looking delightful in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the view screen. “Hello, Commodore Serenity,” he smiled laughingly. The silver coloured cotton suit jacket he was decked out in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the view screen. His feet were shod in some fine green crinkly foil sneakers.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the air conditioning unit. He was looking ready for action in an orange red rayon muscle shirt and some red polyester leggings. On his feet he wore some red polyester boots. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his ears. His deep chin seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. “Hello, Commodore Serenity,” she giggled with an enigmatic twitch of her nose.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was cracking open pecans with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Captain Dwight,” Commander Joe said enigmatically. He was intently polishing the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Navigator Tammy,” Joe Mulbury breathed enigmatically.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a delivery drone buzzed by Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What was that?” she muttered emphatically. She frowned drily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe surveyed the area. He lifted the Chalice of Dreams. Suddenly, he stubbed his toe. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of his hand.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glared in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gestured towards Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight moved her graceful yet strong arm in the direction of Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured to her to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I need to talk to you about”, he began carefully.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“Uh, about last night in the engine room…” said Commander Joe coyly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James went beet red with blushing. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury’s lips.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked around. He held the Star Jewel of Eternity in his hand. Just then, he lost his balance. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“Whoopsy-daisy,” gulped Commander Joe quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glanced slowly at him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont pointed towards Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James moved her soft yet firm hand in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts to eye level. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” he gulped painfully.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James surveyed the area with her eyes. She suddenly had a strange hunch. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” squealed Tammy Smith. She was looking frumpy in a brown silk top and some violet silk slacks with gaudy orange red polka dots. Some orange rayon sneakers graced her feet.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She all of a sudden had a odd intuition. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” cried Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“You displayed some quick thinking today, Ms. O’James!” sighed Captain Dwight calmly. “I think I should promote you to Admiral, Ms. O’James!” he giggled firmly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” chirped Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a tiger. “I’m too modest, I like being a Commodore too!”. She slumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” stated Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a soda after that,” stated Navigator Tammy happily. “Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Joe Mulbury,” she sighed obsequiously.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-mystery-of-the-skull-witch">29. The Mystery of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a view screen off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the navigation dashboard. She was looking impressive in a red and purple denim smock with deep indigo star patterns. On her feet she wore some dark violet rayon dress shoes with pale violet lacy frills.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the air conditioning unit. He put his hand up to his handsome brow. He was looking fine in a handsome blue green leather suit jacket and some pinstripe nylon culottes. The snappy blue rayon boots that were on his feet looked almost new. “Hello, Commodore Serenity,” he breathed virtuously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the air conditioning unit. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his close cropped black hair. He was cracking open walnuts with the Venusian Staff of Power. He was wearing a handsome brown dacron sweater and some tie dyed polyester leggings. His feet were shod in some handsome plaid cotton sneakers.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Ms. O’James. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued hair.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” Captain Dwight breathed peacefully.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a messenger drone whizzed past Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s head. “What the devil was that?” she shouted outrageously. She frowned firmly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont surveyed the area with his eyes. He held the Venusian Staff of Power in his hand. Just then, he stubbed his toe. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith looked at him. She was gotten up in a pinstripe rayon track suit. Some ill fitting maroon dacron boots with gaudy tie dyed polka dots were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe pointed towards Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James gestured towards Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She put her hand up to her overbearing mouth.</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Dwight Edgmont exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. She was looking menacing in a blood coloured leather robe. The black polyester shoes that were on her feet looked almost new. “So sorry to spoil your little party, chums!” she smiled with a voice like a gorilla in a rainstorm. She grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth opened wide in shock.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight exclaimed “OH NO!”.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity clapped her hands to her cheeks in disbelief.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Navigator Tammy!” groaned Commander Joe drily.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Tammy Smith is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” groaned Commodore Serenity icily.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” shouted Joe Mulbury threateningly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a gentle yet strong motion, he lifted the cup of coffee into the light. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” said Commodore Serenity unhappily. She was wearing an elegant deep indigo polyester hoodie with crimson and violet moon beam patterns and an exquisite rainbow hued denim skirt with frilly crimson and violet lace. Her feet were shod in some elegant gold coloured cotton shoes with frilly midnight black lace.</p>
<p>“Enviro readings look normal,” groaned Joe Mulbury, peering down at his hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. He was sporting a navy blue denim jacket and some orange red silk trousers. On his feet he wore some pinstripe crinkly foil shoes.</p>
<p>“… For a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” mumbled Serenity Starlight heavily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. He held the skull of a Space Rat in his hand. “This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,” he groaned sternly.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“What was that noise?” mumbled Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Too quickly for anyone to react, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight just stared, seemingly paralyzed. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury made gestures of surprise with his arms.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” shouted Ms. O’James exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe wasted no time. He helped dig Dwight Edgmont out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“We must act quickly!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James droned. She helped dig Dwight Edgmont out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Joe Mulbury,” stated Captain Dwight enigmatically. “Thank you, Ms. O’James,” he sighed strongly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Commander Joe breathed strongly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was looking completely unimpressive in a maroon silk frock and some white leather culottes with a tacky gold coloured zig zag pattern. Some gaudy tan rayon sneakers with gaudy red polka dots graced her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“I would have been lost without you, Joe Mulbury,” she drawled blissfully. Her narrow forehead in profile cast a shadow against the puddle of icky looking liquid. “I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,” she giggled courageously. “I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she drawled calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. A view screen seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity looked around. She was looking impressive in a fantastic dark purple cotton frock with black and purple lightning bolt patterns and some shimmering rainbow coloured crinkly foil trousers with rainbow coloured lightning bolt patterns. The silvery rayon pixie boots with dark violet lacy frills that were on her feet looked almost new. She suddenly had a unusual intuition. She looked behind the nearby Captain’s chair. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelled Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“There was some top notch action I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight!” giggled Captain Dwight virtuously. The floral print silk great coat he was sporting seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Some blue leather shoes with mauve stripes were on his feet. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Admiral, Commodore Serenity!” he drawled obsequiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” blushed Commodore Serenity calmly. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she giggled laughingly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe slumped down on the sofa. He was wearing a pink dacron muscle shirt with white stripes and some navy blue polyester culottes. On his feet he wore some fine black dacron dress shoes with mauve polyester trim.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” smiled Navigator Tammy fawningly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Dwight Edgmont,” stated Commander Joe courageously.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="29"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-time-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">30. The Time of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was standing near the communications panel. Her perfect forehead seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. She was looking delightful in a beautiful silvery silk gown with gold coloured moon beam patterns. Her feet were shod with some pale violet leather sandals with frilly shiny purple lace.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. He was wearing a maroon cotton jacket and some pink silk slacks. On his feet he wore some fine tie dyed cotton sneakers with pink dacron trim. “Hello, Commodore Serenity,” he drawled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” drawled Captain Dwight Edgmont virtuously. The violet crinkly foil jacket with pinstripe rayon trim he was wearing seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod with some orange cotton trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was looking frumpy in a mauve nylon trench coat with gaudy black polka dots. Her short blonde hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. The pink denim boots on her feet seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” she smiled with an enigmatic twitch of her ears.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was studiously cleaning the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“It’s not the type of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Tammy Smith,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James breathed blissfully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned her to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I wanted to talk about”, he whispered slumblingly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James.</p>
<p>“Um, about the other day in the mess hall…” mumbled Joe Mulbury carefully. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James blushed a deep red. “It’s all right, Joe Mulbury, you don’t need to say anything,” she gasped awkwardly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s The Skull Witch!” Captain Dwight shouted.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. The fine deep red leather jersey she was looking intimidating in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. Her long green hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The snappy deep black cotton sneakers that she had on looked almost new. “We meet again, chums!” she smiled with a voice like a baboon in a snowstorm. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth opened wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont cried “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” shouted Serenity Starlight acidly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He lifted the electro wrench to eye level. He put his hand up to his deep chin. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” he whispered laughingly.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James motioned Joe Mulbury to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk about”, she began coyly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commodore Serenity?” asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked away.</p>
<p>“Yes, Ms. O’James?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Joe and Serenity Starlight moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James scratched her neck.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commodore Serenity?” asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>“Um, … there comes a time when…” gulped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James painingly. She looked around. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. Just then, she was distracted. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” muttered Commodore Serenity quietly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his gentle yet firm hand in the direction of Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. She suddenly had a unusual hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” cried Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Nearby was a torch in a thing on the wall. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” bleated Joe Mulbury grumpily. He was looking smashing in a snappy gold coloured polyester jumpsuit. Some orange polyester shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity dialed up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro metrics look normal,” breathed Serenity Starlight firmly. She was looking fine in a marvellous shimmering purple dacron smock with frilly purple and white lace. On her feet she wore some exquisite deep violet polyester shoes with shiny silver lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>“… For a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” groaned Commander Joe irritatedly. He picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. He lifted the bottle caps to eye level. “These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,” he said slowly.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>“What was that noise?” breathed Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Without warning, with a tremendous boom, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont just stared, seemingly paralyzed. He was wearing a floral print denim sweater and some chartreuse cotton trousers. The mauve silk shoes that were on his feet looked almost new. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Commander Joe made motions of shock with his hands.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight clapped her hands on the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking impressive in a blood coloured crinkly foil track suit with dark black dacron trim. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on his shoulder length green locks. His feet were shod with some black polyester shoes.</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” screamed Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. “So sorry to spoil your little party, chums!” he drawled with a voice like a gorilla in a snowstorm. He grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James put her hands to her cheeks in shock. “Let’s keep moving,” she shouted irritatedly.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Serenity Starlight,” he said lightly. “There’s no time to lose!” he yelled. He helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“Hurry!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James breathed. She helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Commander Joe,” whispered Captain Dwight courageously. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he smiled strongly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James were attacked by some Space Ostriches.</p>
<p>A epic skirmish had begun!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Ostriches littered the area.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” groaned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James impatiently. “It looked like those Space Ostriches had The Skull Witch’s insignia on their armor,” she drawled virtuously. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” muttered Joe Mulbury downheartedly.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Ms. O’James chirped placidly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“I would have been a goner without you, Joe Mulbury,” she giggled strongly. “I am in debt to you, Dwight Edgmont,” she sighed firmly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a plaid dacron tank top and a purple nylon skirt. Some tacky black crinkly foil pixie boots were on her feet. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight,” she stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>“There was some ace action from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” chirped Captain Dwight obsequiously. He was sporting a tie dyed nylon jumpsuit. The handsome black dacron boots that were on his feet looked almost new. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Admiral, Serenity Starlight!” he whispered energetically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” sighed Commodore Serenity, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. The fantastic crimson and purple nylon halter top with purple and white lacy frills she was looking delightful in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. Some shimmering rainbow coloured silk sandals with purple nylon trim were on her feet. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “I could really go for a hamburger after that,” she sighed firmly.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” drawled Joe Mulbury calmly.</p>
<p>With a exquisite yet strong motion, Captain Dwight slumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a curry right now,” drawled Navigator Tammy fawningly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Serenity Starlight,” breathed Commander Joe enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="30"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-revenge-of-the-venusian-staff-of-power">31. The Revenge of The Venusian Staff of Power</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A Captain’s chair gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the pantry and it looks like we are fresh out of eggs,” smiled Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James peacefully. The WICKED AWESOME indigo nylon tank top with purple and gold cotton trim she was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod in some fantastic shiny purple rayon pumps adorned with jewels.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal. The handsome pink dacron smock with tie dyed nylon trim he was looking delightful in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. On his feet he wore some white crinkly foil shoes. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he whispered strongly.</p>
<p>“I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are plum out of Space Sugar,” chirped Captain Dwight Edgmont blissfully. His deep chin in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel. “Hello, Commodore Serenity,” he drawled courageously. The snappy pinstripe cotton jersey he was looking exciting in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The snappy blue cotton shoes he was looking exciting in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. He was cracking open pecans with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy Smith. Her narrow forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Tammy Smith,” Dwight Edgmont giggled courageously.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was intently cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Commodore Serenity.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” Joe Mulbury stated strongly. He looked around. He held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in his hand. All of a sudden, he lost his balance. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of his hand. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy gestured towards him. She was looking tastless in a pink leather jersey and some gold coloured silk slacks. Some navy blue silk sneakers with gaudy floral print polka dots graced her feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his graceful yet strong hand in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight pointed towards Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a delivery drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What in Sam Hill was that?” he breathed firmly. He winked peacefully.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury gestured to Commodore Serenity to step aside from the others for a moment. “There’s a thing I wanted to talk about”, he began coyly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Commodore Serenity.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked away.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Joe and Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the Captain’s chair.</p>
<p>The faces of Ms. O’James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“Uh, …” said Joe Mulbury painingly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Commander Joe?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Ms. O’James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“You know, … there comes a time when…” said Joe Mulbury coyly.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” barked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. “I have you now!” he chirped with a voice like an elephant in a bazaar. His ugly brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. He snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. He was gotten up in a handsome deep red rayon smock with deep black stripes. The red silk boots that were on his feet looked almost new. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth opened wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont exclaimed “Nooooooooooooo!”.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James made gestures of shock with her hands.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Tammy Smith is being held!” chirped Captain Dwight lightly.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” yelled Commodore Serenity menacingly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont laughingly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. There was a torch in a thing on the wall off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the chills,” muttered Commodore Serenity slowly. She was wearing an exquisite rainbow hued dacron shirt adorned with emeralds and some elegant purple and violet crinkly foil culottes with frilly purple lace. Her feet were shod with some exquisite multi coloured cotton boots with frilly pale violet lace.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight opened up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. “Enviro readings look normal,” sighed Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a DUMP!!” groaned Ms. O’James unhappily.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont surveyed the area. He was sporting a handsome chartreuse silk jumper with navy blue polyester trim and some blue crinkly foil culottes. The pink silk sneakers on his feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light. With a supple yet confident motion, he lifted the Venusian Staff of Power to eye level. Just then, he tripped. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“Drat,” stated Dwight Edgmont quietly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe moved his gentle yet masterful arm in the direction of him. He was looking delightful in an orange red rayon jumpsuit with black stripes. On his feet he wore some handsome green nylon trainers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked at Captain Dwight. She looked around. She suddenly had a odd inkling. She looked behind the nearby torch in a thing on the wall. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” squealed Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James smiled happily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was looking completely unimpressive in a gold coloured nylon jumper and a tacky pink cotton skirt. Some purple rayon pixie boots were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Joe Mulbury,” she breathed energetically. “I would have been lost without you, Dwight Edgmont,” she smiled calmly. “I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she said calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. In the centre of the area was a Captain’s chair. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area. She was decked out in an exquisite crimson denim halter top with deep violet lacy frills and some beautiful purple dacron trousers with violet star patterns. Her feet were shod with some beautiful white denim sneakers with silvery polyester trim. She all of a sudden had a strange hunch. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” yelled Commander Joe. He was looking delightful in a handsome silver coloured rayon robe. The snappy yellow cotton sneakers with tan polyester trim that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“You displayed some ace action today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” drawled Dwight Edgmont energetically. “I think I should promote you to Admiral, Commodore Serenity!” he giggled energetically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Commodore Serenity calmly. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she breathed happily.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” drawled Joe Mulbury blissfully.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith flumped down on the couch. The navy blue polyester blouse with gaudy pinstripe polka dots she was looking completely unimpressive in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some tasteless red silk sandals.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Commander Joe,” stated Ms. O’James placidly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="31"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-mystery-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">32. The Mystery of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. A navigation dashboard seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. Her perfect forehead in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit. The fantastic multi coloured rayon tank top with multi hued lacy frills she was decked out in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. The fantastic purple and gold rayon trainers with shiny silver moon beam patterns that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” smiled Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. He was looking impressive in an orange leather jumper and some snappy green cotton culottes. On his feet he wore some snappy navy blue denim boots with navy blue stripes.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” giggled Captain Dwight Edgmont enigmatically. He was resplendent in a blue green polyester jerkin and some tie dyed nylon culottes. His feet were shod in some handsome brown crinkly foil trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. “Hello, Commodore Serenity,” she chirped with an enigmatic twitch of her ears. She was cracking open pecans with the Venusian Staff of Power. She was looking frumpy in a silver coloured leather long coat. She put her hand up to her narrow forehead. Some plaid dacron sandals were on her feet.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“It’s not the type of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Captain Dwight,” Navigator Tammy smiled calmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was wearing a snappy dark black polyester hoodie with blood red leather trim and some snappy blood red polyester leggings. The red leather sneakers that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“The Skull Witch!” Dwight Edgmont yelled.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her long green hair. “What have we here!” she chirped with a voice like a hurricane in a performance art piece. She snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with her.</p>
<p>“NOOO!” barked Tammy Smith icily.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight made gestures of surprise with his hands.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James barked “NOOO!”. She picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She held the electro wrench in her hand. “This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,” she barked outrageously.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked around. She lifted the Venusian Staff of Power to eye level. Suddenly, she stubbed her toe. She lost her grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Whoops,” said Navigator Tammy quietly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glanced peacefully at her. His close cropped black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James moved her smooth yet confident arm in the direction of Navigator Tammy. She picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she muttered irritatedly.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“YOU!” bellowed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. “I have you now!” he giggled with a voice like a baboon driving a race car. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. He was looking villanous in some dark red denim coveralls with dark black denim trim. Some snappy midnight black dacron trainers were on his feet. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith clapped her hands on her cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There was a puddle of icky looking liquid off in the corner. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the chills,” intoned Tammy Smith sadly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a mauve cotton jacket with a tacky purple zig zag pattern and a gaudy blue dacron skirt with gaudy pinstripe polka dots. The brown denim pixie boots on her feet seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>“Enviro readings look normal,” said Commodore Serenity, looking down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. She was looking smashing in an exquisite purple dacron leotard with pale violet lacy frills. Her feet were shod in some WICKED AWESOME multi coloured nylon pumps with shiny purple lacy frills.</p>
<p>“Normal, sure… for a DUMP!!” droned Tammy Smith drily. “Let’s keep moving,” she groaned grumpily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,” he giggled strongly. “Thank you, Commodore Serenity,” he chirped placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. Not too far away was a communications panel. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. She was wearing a fantastic silver coloured leather trench coat with silvery lacy frills. On her feet she wore some beautiful pale indigo leather shoes with red and purple lightning bolt patterns. She all of a sudden had a unusual intuition. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” exclaimed Tammy Smith. She was gotten up in an ill fitting tan silk jacket with a tacky pinstripe zig zag pattern and some silver coloured denim slacks. The orange silk pixie boots that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you’d expect. A torch in a thing on the wall gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Weasels came around the corner.</p>
<p>“Space Weasels!” hissed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Epzinvti xueem eqj ndrwfp tkvsnuj evq!!!” shouted the Space Weasels in their strange Space Weasel language.</p>
<p>A fierce battle took place!</p>
<p>“BY THE METEORS OF VENUS!!!” cried Dwight Edgmont. He was looking ready for action in a fine brown denim suit jacket and some tie dyed nylon culottes. Some handsome mauve polyester shoes with pink polyester trim graced his feet. He drew the vibro sword out of his belt. He raised the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a tremendous movement.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Weasels with a tremendous whack.</p>
<p>The Space Weasels went flying across the room.</p>
<p>“BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!” barked Ms. O’James. She was wearing a beautiful indigo nylon hoodie with pale purple nylon trim and a beautiful white denim skirt adorned with sapphires. Her feet were shod with some exquisite rainbow hued nylon trainers with shimmering rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her backpack. She heaved the Venusian Katana of Power above her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a tremendous movement.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Weasels with a awesome thud.</p>
<p>The Space Weasels went flying across the room.</p>
<p>“BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!” bellowed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her backpack. She heaved the Venusian Katana of Power above her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a tremendous force.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Weasels with a mighty thud.</p>
<p>The Space Weasels went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, stunned Space Weasels were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” shouted Navigator Tammy gratingly.</p>
<p>“It looked like those Space Weasels had The Skull Witch’s insignia on their uniforms,” giggled Serenity Starlight obsequiously. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” gulped Tammy Smith heavily. She was looking frumpy in a pinstripe dacron long coat. On her feet she wore some purple cotton shoes. “Let’s keep moving,” she bleated drily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! The snappy tan cotton hoodie he was decked out in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. Some orange cotton dress shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Navigator Tammy,” he whispered happily. “I would have been lost without you, Captain Dwight,” he stated fawningly. His handsome brow in profile threw a shadow on the torch in a thing on the wall. “I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight,” he whispered fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some quick thinking today, Commodore Serenity!” said Captain Dwight peacefully. He was sporting a tie dyed leather robe. His feet were shod in some yellow rayon trainers with blue stripes. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Admiral, Ms. O’James!” he chirped energetically.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” chirped Ms. O’James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was looking delightful in a midnight black dacron jerkin with purple and gold lightning bolt patterns and some elegant red and purple polyester trousers with shiny silver lightning bolt patterns. On her feet she wore some exquisite purple and white polyester dress shoes with frilly dark purple lace. “I’m too modest, I like being a Commodore too!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she chirped happily.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” smiled Dwight Edgmont firmly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a pizza right now,” giggled Navigator Tammy obsequiously.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Navigator Tammy,” sighed Serenity Starlight placidly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-phantom-of-the-skull-witch">33. The Phantom of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. Nearby was an air conditioning unit. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. She was decked out in a beautiful pale indigo leather frock with midnight black denim trim and some elegant indigo rayon slacks adorned with gems. The marvellous silver coloured crinkly foil sandals with pale violet dacron trim that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” stated Commander Joe Mulbury calmly. His handsome brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He was looking fine in a silver coloured rayon jumper and some brown nylon slacks. On his feet he wore some green polyester boots with navy blue stripes.</p>
<p>“Hello, Commander Joe,” smiled Captain Dwight Edgmont with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. He was looking ready for action in a handsome gold coloured silk top and some silver coloured denim slacks. Some fine chartreuse denim dress shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the communications panel. She was looking frumpy in a silver coloured dacron long coat. The yellow nylon boots she was gotten up in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. Her short blonde hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she said with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was intently cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,” Captain Dwight chirped placidly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his close cropped black locks.</p>
<p>With a supple yet forceful motion, Joe Mulbury motioned Serenity Starlight to step away from the others for a moment. “There’s something I wanted to say to you”, he began carefully.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Serenity Starlight. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the view screen.</p>
<p>“Uh, about the other day in the engine room…” gulped Commander Joe coyly.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity went beet red with blushing. “Words are not necessary, Commander Joe” she gulped awkwardly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He lifted the cup of coffee into the light. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” he bleated grumpily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a security drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith’s head. “What in the world was that?” she intoned gratingly. She blinked strongly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight looked around. He held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in his hand. Suddenly, he was distracted. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of his grip.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glanced drily at him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glared in the direction of Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James looked at Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>“The Skull Witch!” Joe Mulbury shouted.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wildly. “We meet again, do-gooders!” she giggled with a voice like a giraffe in a mosh pit. She was looking menacing in a snappy deep red crinkly foil jumper and some red crinkly foil slacks. The snappy red cotton pumps that she had on looked almost new. She grabbed Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>“Nooooooooooooo!” bellowed Tammy Smith with a voice like a tiger in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury’s mouth gawped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James put her hands to the sides of her face in surprise.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There were some manacles off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” droned Ms. O’James slowly. She was looking delightful in an exquisite silvery rayon jerkin adorned with rubies and some elegant rainbow coloured rayon leggings with dark indigo lightning bolt patterns. The fantastic white polyester dress shoes with purple and gold lacy frills she was wearing seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>“Enviro measurements look normal,” breathed Dwight Edgmont, gazing down at his hyper crystal’s enviro probe app. He was resplendent in a handsome maroon dacron robe with purple crinkly foil trim. His feet were shod with some fine maroon denim dress shoes.</p>
<p>“… For a DUMP!!” groaned Commodore Serenity grumpily.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Navigator Tammy intoned icily. She was wearing a tacky plaid crinkly foil trench coat with gaudy pink polka dots. Her feet were shod in some blue denim sandals.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>“I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,” he smiled happily. “I would have been toast without you, Commander Joe,” he giggled enigmatically. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he smiled virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James surveyed the area. She was decked out in a marvellous shimmering multi hued polyester gown adorned with jewels. On her feet she wore some marvellous silvery leather pumps with shimmering purple star patterns. She suddenly had a funny inkling. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” yelped Dwight Edgmont. “That was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Ms. O’James!” he stated enigmatically. He was wearing a fine red leather muscle shirt and some handsome black silk culottes. Some snappy mauve nylon trainers were on his feet. “I think I should promote you to Admiral, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he stated placidly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” blushed Commodore Serenity courageously. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” giggled Joe Mulbury laughingly. He was sporting a brown nylon sweater and some purple nylon culottes with chartreuse stripes. The yellow denim shoes that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight slumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a parmo after that,” whispered Tammy Smith calmly. The tan silk long coat she was wearing seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. Some pinstripe crinkly foil dress shoes graced her feet.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Dwight Edgmont,” smiled Ms. O’James enigmatically.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-secret-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">34. The Secret of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was an air conditioning unit off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the communications panel. She was wearing an exquisite rainbow coloured rayon sweater adorned with emeralds and a marvellous rainbow hued nylon skirt adorned with jewels. She put her hand up to her perfect forehead. On her feet she wore some fantastic silvery silk trainers adorned with gems.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the navigation dashboard. “Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” he said energetically. He was sporting a handsome navy blue rayon jersey and some gold coloured denim slacks. The orange red rayon trainers with plaid nylon trim on his feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal. His deep chin in profile cast a shadow against the Captain’s chair. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” he stated with an enigmatic twitch of his ears. He was sporting a handsome pinstripe silk shirt and some red silk culottes. The mauve leather shoes he was resplendent in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the navigation dashboard. She was wearing a white leather jerkin with gaudy black polka dots and some blue green nylon trousers with a tacky orange zig zag pattern. Her feet were shod in some mauve rayon pixie boots. Her narrow forehead in profile threw a shadow on the view screen. “Hello, Commander Joe,” she sighed energetically. She was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity, it’s pretty special, isn’t it?” asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Joe Mulbury,” Tammy Smith smiled strongly. She picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she sighed obsequiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a surveillance drone buzzed by Commander Joe Mulbury’s head. “What in blazes was that?” he groaned gratingly. He blinked outrageously. He put his hand up to his handsome brow. He gestured to Ms. O’James to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to say to you”, he began painfully.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury scratched his head.</p>
<p>“Yes, Commander Joe?” asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked away.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The faces of Admiral Serenity and Joe Mulbury moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury scratched his neck.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Admiral Serenity moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“Well, … there comes a time when…” whispered Joe Mulbury coyly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked around. She lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity to eye level. Just then, she stubbed her toe. She lost her grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith’s face.</p>
<p>With a supple yet powerful motion, Joe Mulbury pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glared in the direction of Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James glanced grumpily at Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a delivery drone whizzed past Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What in blazes was that?” he said fawningly. He beamed virtuously.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity surveyed the area. She suddenly had a unusual hunch. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>“What a relief!” cried Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some ace thinking today, Serenity Starlight!” breathed Dwight Edgmont lightly. “I think I should promote you to Super Admiral, Admiral Serenity!” he stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” blushed Ms. O’James calmly. “It’s enough to know I’m fighting on the side of good!”. “All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” she drawled energetically.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” drawled Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a parmo after that,” drawled Navigator Tammy laughingly.</p>
<p>“Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Tammy Smith,” breathed Ms. O’James energetically.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">35. The Time of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A view screen seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. She was wearing a beautiful rainbow coloured denim blouse adorned with sapphires and some exquisite pale purple silk trousers with purple and violet moon beam patterns. The white leather pumps with frilly black and purple lace that were on her feet looked almost new. Her perfect forehead seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the air conditioning unit. His close cropped black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He was resplendent in a floral print crinkly foil muscle shirt and some red denim slacks. Some snappy floral print silk shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. She was intently cleaning the Venusian Staff of Power. She was wearing a pink silk top with a tacky pinstripe zig zag pattern and a black cotton skirt with gaudy tan polka dots. The navy blue dacron sneakers that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>“That Venusian Staff of Power means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“It means a lot to all of us, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” Tammy Smith smiled fawningly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her short blonde locks.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was cracking open pecans with the Star Jewel of Eternity. He was sporting a blue green nylon jerkin and some maroon denim leggings with orange red nylon trim. His feet were shod in some orange red silk shoes with purple stripes.</p>
<p>“That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn’t it?” asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>“Space Fighters Command doesn’t entrust us with just any old thing, Tammy Smith,” Joe Mulbury giggled calmly. His short blonde hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a supple yet confident motion, she lifted the cup of coffee to eye level. “This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,” she sighed happily.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned her to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I wanted to talk about”, he groaned painingly.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>“What is it, Joe Mulbury?” asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>“Uh, …” gulped Joe Mulbury awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Joe and Serenity Starlight moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>“Well, … there comes a time when…” breathed Joe Mulbury slowly. He looked around. He held the Star Jewel of Eternity in his hand. All of a sudden, he was distracted. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of his grip.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>“Oops,” breathed Commander Joe quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont glanced lightly at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight glared in the direction of Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a messenger drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont’s head. “What the devil was that?” he giggled peacefully. He whistled laughingly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith surveyed the area. She lifted the Venusian Staff of Power. All of a sudden, she stumbled. The Venusian Staff of Power slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>

<p>“What a relief!” cried Captain Dwight. “That was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James!” he smiled blissfully. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Super Admiral, Admiral Serenity!” he smiled obsequiously.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” said Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a tiger. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. She flumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” chirped Commander Joe blissfully.</p>
<p>“I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” drawled Dwight Edgmont obsequiously.</p>

<h2 id="the-space-otters">36. The Space Otters</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you’d expect. In the centre of the area was a Captain’s chair. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. She was wearing a purple and violet crinkly foil dress with white leather trim. On her feet she wore some beautiful crimson silk boots with pale indigo moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the air conditioning unit. He was sporting a snappy plaid polyester jumper and some handsome floral print denim leggings. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short blonde hair. His feet were shod with some brown denim sneakers. “Hello, Ms. O’James,” he said with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal. “Hello, Joe Mulbury,” he chirped happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the Captain’s chair. Her narrow forehead in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel. She was gotten up in a white cotton trench coat. Some orange red silk trainers with gaudy silver coloured polka dots graced her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was intently polishing the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it’s kind of special, isn’t it?” asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Admiral Serenity,” Joe Mulbury said laughingly. He looked around. He held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in his hand. Just then, he was distracted. He lost his grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury’s face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her exquisite yet forceful hand in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his exquisite yet forceful hand in the direction of Commander Joe. He was resplendent in a snappy orange red dacron long coat. On his feet he wore some plaid rayon trainers.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity looked at Joe Mulbury. She motioned Joe Mulbury to step back from the others for a moment. “There’s something I need to talk about”, she whispered slowly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Admiral Serenity?” asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>“You know, about last night in the mess hall…” gasped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James carefully. Her perfect forehead in profile cast a shadow against the view screen.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury blushed a deep red. “Speak not of it, Serenity Starlight” he groaned enigmatically.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! His ugly brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>“Nebulon!” Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. He was gotten up in a deep black dacron great coat with midnight black polyester trim. The snappy midnight black rayon shoes with red stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. “What have we here!” he whispered with a voice like a tiger in a mosh pit. He grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” shouted Tammy Smith acidly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont made gestures of disbelief with his hands.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James bellowed “OH NO!”.</p>
<p>“We must find out where that villian has taken Commander Joe!” raged Tammy Smith heavily.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Commander Joe is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” yelled Admiral Serenity firmly.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” bellowed Navigator Tammy strongly. She picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” she barked firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. A door to the dungeon gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“This place gives me the willies,” groaned Admiral Serenity drily. She was sporting a pale indigo nylon jacket with dark indigo lacy frills and some elegant pale purple nylon leggings with crimson and violet cotton trim. On her feet she wore some marvellous crimson and purple crinkly foil pumps adorned with emeralds.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith started the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. “Enviro measurements look normal,” muttered Navigator Tammy heavily.</p>
<p>“Normal, yeah… for a DISASTER AREA!!” muttered Serenity Starlight drily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James spotted some Space Otters in the distance.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’ve found us,” muttered Ms. O’James downheartedly.</p>
<p>“Hea ncvz bnyftqo pmrexq friwcurj!!!” shouted the Space Otters in their weird Space Otter language.</p>
<p>A epic skirmish took place!</p>
<p>“BY THE METEORS OF VENUS!!!” yelped Dwight Edgmont. He drew the vibro sword out of his belt. He was wearing a brown dacron muscle shirt and some violet polyester trousers with purple stripes. He put his hand up to his deep chin. Some orange cotton sneakers were on his feet. He lifted the vibro sword over his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a tremendous movement.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Otters with a mighty thud.</p>
<p>The Space Otters went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Otters littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>“That was a close one!” raged Navigator Tammy drily. “It looked like those Space Otters had Nebulon the Dastardly’s insignia on their clothes,” she drawled firmly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a bleak plaid silk jumper with gaudy floral print polka dots and a tacky white leather skirt. Her feet were shod with some maroon silk boots. “Remember to include that in the report when we get home.”.</p>
<p>“IF we get home,” groaned Serenity Starlight drably. “Let’s keep moving,” she gasped exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,” he drawled virtuously. He was sporting a tie dyed silk sweater and some violet dacron leggings. The fine blue green leather sandals that he had on looked almost new. “I would have been a goner without you, Dwight Edgmont,” he breathed virtuously. “Thank you, Ms. O’James,” he stated lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you’d expect. A Captain’s chair seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>Ms. O’James surveyed the area with her eyes. She was looking impressive in an exquisite red and purple leather suit jacket with purple and white lightning bolt patterns and some marvellous crimson and violet leather culottes with violet star patterns. On her feet she wore some purple crinkly foil sneakers with frilly shimmering rainbow hued lace. She suddenly had a funny intuition. She looked behind the nearby Captain’s chair. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief!” exclaimed Tammy Smith. She was gotten up in an ill fitting pinstripe cotton leotard. Her feet were shod with some green rayon dress shoes.</p>
<p>“There was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Admiral Serenity!” sighed Captain Dwight fawningly. “I think I should promote you to Super Admiral, Admiral Serenity!” he said happily.</p>
<p>“Oh, Captain Dwight!” said Serenity Starlight energetically. “I’m too modest, I like being a Admiral too!”. “What an adventure that was!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a curry after that,” sighed Joe Mulbury lightly. He was looking smashing in a green polyester jerkin and some handsome pink denim trousers. Some mauve dacron trainers were on his feet.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” giggled Captain Dwight obsequiously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy flumped down on the bean bag chair. “Maybe next time you’ll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Joe Mulbury,” she breathed courageously.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="36"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-phantom-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">37. The Phantom of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A view screen gleamed in the fluorescent light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was looking fine in an exquisite silver coloured polyester tank top with crimson and purple lacy frills and some beautiful purple and gold silk trousers with multi hued lacy frills. The exquisite pale violet silk boots with frilly shimmering rainbow coloured lace that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the air conditioning unit. “Hello, Serenity Starlight,” he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. He was looking delightful in a fine floral print silk hoodie and some purple dacron trousers. On his feet he wore some tie dyed rayon shoes with pink stripes.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the air conditioning unit. “Hello, Admiral Serenity,” he whispered courageously. The orange nylon suit jacket he was looking ready for action in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. The snappy navy blue denim dress shoes with floral print stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. His deep chin in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. Her narrow forehead in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard. She was wearing a tan silk track suit. Some blue polyester shoes with gaudy maroon polka dots were on her feet. “Hello, Commander Joe,” she breathed courageously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a security drone whizzed past Commander Joe Mulbury’s head. “What in the world was that?” he shouted viciously. His short blonde hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He frowned exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>“It’s YOU!” squealed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled disdainfully. “So sorry to spoil your party, chums!” he giggled with a voice like a rabid dog in a bazaar. He snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. He was wearing a snappy midnight black denim muscle shirt and some dark red denim slacks. His feet were shod in some snappy blood red denim boots. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury made motions of disbelief with his hands.</p>
<p>“OH NO!” yelped Dwight Edgmont with a voice like a tiger in a jewellery store.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity clapped her hands on her cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>“We must find out where Navigator Tammy is being held!” groaned Joe Mulbury enigmatically.</p>
<p>“I have a strong feeling Tammy Smith is in the Nebulon’s fortress stronghold,” splurted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James drily.</p>
<p>“Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,” bellowed Joe Mulbury impatiently.</p>
<p>With a exquisite yet powerful motion, Dwight Edgmont picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts to eye level. “These star charts represents how I feel inside,” he smiled strongly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking intimidating in a handsome deep red dacron leotard. Her feet were shod with some dark red polyester shoes.</p>
<p>“YOU!” shouted Ms. O’James. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her wicked long (down to her knees) shimmering multi hued locks.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. “We meet again, do-gooders!” she said with a voice like a ninja in a pet shop. She snatched Commander Joe from behind. She put her hand up to her overbearing mouth. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight exclaimed “NOOO!”.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James’s mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Not too far away were some manacles. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the look of this place,” said Commander Joe weakly. The snappy maroon silk great coat he was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. Some snappy green rayon trainers with violet cotton trim graced his feet.</p>
<p>“Enviro metrics look normal,” bellowed Admiral Serenity, peering down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. She was looking delightful in a beautiful shimmering rainbow hued cotton leotard with shimmering rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. On her feet she wore some beautiful silver and purple leather pixie boots with dark indigo cotton trim.</p>
<p>“Yeah, normal… for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!” mumbled Joe Mulbury unhappily.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Admiral Serenity intoned irritatedly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>“I would have been toast without you, Captain Dwight,” he drawled happily. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight,” he sighed lightly. He gestured to Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James to step aside from the others for a moment.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe Mulbury?” asked Ms. O’James.</p>
<p>“Serenity Starlight, you are so exquisitely beautiful, like a jewel,” giggled Commander Joe. “I must kiss you!”.</p>
<p>“Oh, Joe Mulbury!” giggled Admiral Serenity, blushing fiercely like a bonfire.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity and Commander Joe kissed! And they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed! “Oh, Joe Mulbury!” she smiled, blushing fiercely like a bonfire.</p>
<p>“Let’s keep moving,” Captain Dwight said happily. He was resplendent in a red nylon jacket and some fine tie dyed crinkly foil culottes. The floral print cotton sneakers that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>“I am in debt to you, Commander Joe,” she chirped strongly. She was looking tastless in a tacky violet rayon jerkin and some green polyester culottes. Some pink silk boots with a tacky red zig zag pattern were on her feet. “I would have been a goner without you, Dwight Edgmont,” she drawled energetically. “Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James,” she chirped happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O’James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. There was an air conditioning unit off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>“I saw you display some ace action today, Admiral Serenity!” sighed Dwight Edgmont laughingly. He was sporting a fine green cotton great coat. His feet were shod with some handsome chartreuse silk shoes. “How would you like a promotion to the rank of Super Admiral, Admiral Serenity!” he drawled placidly.</p>
<p>“Oh, Dwight Edgmont!” said Admiral Serenity lightly. She was wearing a marvellous midnight black polyester sweater with violet star patterns and some red and purple denim leggings with rainbow hued lacy frills. On her feet she wore some exquisite pale violet denim pumps with frilly pale violet lace. “I’m not in this for rank, I do it out of love!”. “I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,” she drawled firmly.</p>
<p>“I could really go for a curry after that,” stated Joe Mulbury placidly. The snappy pink dacron suit jacket he was decked out in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The yellow leather shoes with plaid stripes that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>“All in a day’s work for the Space Fighters!” whispered Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>“What an adventure that was!” exclaimed Tammy Smith. She was looking completely unimpressive in a black silk sweater and some tacky tan denim culottes. The tan silk pumps that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
